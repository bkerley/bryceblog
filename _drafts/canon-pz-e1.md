PHOTO OF THE UNIT

The Canon PZ-E1 is an intriguing little lens accessory. It adds smooth zooming
to the [EF-S18-135mm f/3.5-5.6 IS USM][the_lens] lens.

# A Quick Intro to Lens Accessories, Lenses, and Cameras

In modern parlance, a camera's a tool for capturing an image. There's a lens
for capturing light, a sensing medium that undergoes changes due to the light,
and affordances to transform the changed medium into a new image. For a
wonderful and exhaustive introduction to how these systems work, check out
["Cameras and Lenses" by Bartosz Ciechanowski][cameras_and_lenses].

Photography is fun as hell and also important for modern society, and there're
a bunch of engineering tradeoffs to be made when making cameras. You can't take
a picture if you don't have a camera, so there's tremendous value in having a
small but complete camera system jammed into a smartphone, and that's
legitimately an incredible combination that's got billions of people having fun
taking pictures.

On the flipmode, if you're willing to deal with a bigger, heavier camera that
does less than a phone, you're going to be spending that weight and volume
on a nicer sensor, and a mechanism to allow swapping lens assemblies. If you
have the right configuration ready at the right time, you can take a
better-looking picture than a phone camera, just because the physics works
better when you have more lens and sensor area to capture light with.

SLR AND PHONE PICTURES OF THE SAME THING

A convenient thing is for lenses to be able to change their length/angle, or
"zoom" to change the composition of a shot independent of where the camera is
in physical space. Zooming is nice in still photography, but super useful in
cinematography, which thrives on being able to recompose a frame gradually for
artistic goals.

# Cinematography

I don't have any formal cinematography training. In the '90s and early '00s,
I took video production classes in middle and high school using VHS
camcorders, we had an 8mm camcorder at home, and all of those had 
smooth pushbutton zoom. If you've seen videos from that era, you're familiar
with the look. 
For me, it evokes a low-resolution time and date superimposed in the
corner, a TV showing a harsh blue screen on a metal cart, and the flimsy little
fade lever on a Videonics MX-1 Digital Video Mixer.

Smooth zoom is useful beyond those formative memories though; it enables a
"dolly zoom" cinematographic technique. Zooming in on a character while moving
the camera away, or the reverse zoom-out while moving in, evokes an uneasy
feeling of the character's perception or relationship with the world rapidly
changing.

What lens does it work with? EF-S 18-135mm IS USM; which only has motorized focus, with the focus ring just asking the computer to change focus (like a flappy paddle automatic)

Batteries? Does it work with the computer or phone apps?

Why though?
