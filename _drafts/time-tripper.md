I played a lot of shareware Doom growing up, 
but I never really got into downloading maps online.
We only had one phone line, and as a result I didn't
have much of an on-ramp to online communities until
Doom had been disregarded in favor of newer and shinier
games.

<aside>
I'm going to be referring to "Doom" a lot here.
That means Doom 1, and stuff that's generally
considered part of the Doom 1 lexicon.
The retail Doom 2 and Final Doom,
the Eternity Engine and GZDoom source ports,
mods playable in such ports.
Not really Doom 3 or later.

And I'm not doing the all-caps thing either,
have some self-respect.

Decades later, I found myself getting back in,
after seeing the review and a screenshot of
[Ancient Aliens][aaliens] in the
[2016 Cacowards][caco-2016]. 
This wasn't the greys and browns of my childhood,
but something new and vivid.
It was still Doom, 
but it wasn't afraid to be its own vision of Doom.
Same monsters[^aaliens-monsters],
but a new architecture, a new setting,
a new *vocabulary* of shooty game.

[^aaliens-monsters]: well, except for a couple new ones

[aaliens]: https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Ancient_Aliens
[caco-2016]: https://www.doomworld.com/23years/best1.php

I've spent way more time with Ancient Aliens
than Dooms 2016 or Eternal.
It launches faster, it's less involved,
and honestly it's a comfy experience
even though it's *weird* in a way that cannot be
commercially viable.

Since then I've played a handful of new wads[^wads]

[^wads]: Doom and mods traditionally came in `.WAD`
    files, which is Where All the Data are. 
    Some modern Doom content
