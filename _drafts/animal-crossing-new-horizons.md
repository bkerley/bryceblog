I remember when my friend Will got "Animal Crossing" for Gamecube. It looked
cool the first night, it looked cool a week later, but I got yelled at when
I asked to make a character and cut down a bunch of trees, because Will had
to listen to Mr. Resetti gripe about Will rolling back my changes the
fast way. It seemed cute, but I wasn't at Will's enough to find any fulfillment
from his copy, and I wasn't planning on buying a Gamecube.

For like eighteen years after that I'd hear about Animal Crossing occasionally,
see one of their characters throw down against a generic anime swordhaver in
Smash Bros., but I didn't really have any interest in a Nintendo DS or Wii.

When I lived with Will, and he got "The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild"
(BOTW)
for Wii U, I watched him play a bunch and lucked into getting a Switch for that
game (which is perfect, wish I could play it for the first time again).
Another benefit of living with Will was getting to use his gaming PC to play
"Doom" (the 2016 version that I refer to as "Doom 4"), which is also perfect.

From 2017 through 2019, on Switch, I
ended up with
"Mario Kart 8 Deluxe" (good, dreading the day I have to destroy
a nephew or niece in it),
"Splatoon 2" (keep reading!),
"Golf Story" (it's alright, the golfing got too hard for my
patience),
and a few other games in 2017. Through 2018 and 2019 I played *a lot* of
Splatoon 2, and quite a few single-player games, often while traveling.
I deleted a trans-Atlantic trip with "Dead Cells," and trans-Pacific
flights with "Celeste," "Night in the Woods," and "Shovel Knight." I tried
the "Dark Souls" port and hated it.
I played through "Super Mario Odyssey" over the course of a few weekends and
found it brilliant. Once you beat the big boss and get the credits roll, the
set of new goals that was hinted at throughout unlock and the real game
begins.

A lot of people I chat with online were lamenting the simultaneous
announcements
(at the end of a fiscal quarter, thinking emoji) that "Doom Eternal" and
"Animal Crossing: New Horizons" ("New Horizons" or "ACNH")
would be pushed back to 2020, and I was a bit
sad but it's not like I was going to bother with a gaming PC or an
Animal Crossing game so whatever.

But "New Horizons" kept coming up in conversation. Outside a film
screening in February 2020, I got in a conversation about if this new virus
would make it to the US, but another person changed the topic to if
Tom Nook (the racoon bureaucrat) is a villain for immediately and repeatedly
putting you into debt, or benign for giving you a home with no strict
obligation to pay for the privilege.

I went on a business trip March 9, 2020. Through the course of the week,
the news got pretty grim pretty quickly. First, the Starbucks near the
destination banned personal cups. Then, my coworkers decided they needed
to rush home while they still could. The meeting ended with a dire warning to
tell the project owners if we did get symptoms in the coming weeks.

Finally, while I was waiting for my bag back in Miami, the TV news was saying
that the (completely dog shit) mayor got COVID from Bolsonaro's visit.

The week after that was weird. I first made a mask out of a T-shirt, bought
some masks, did some woodworking, was very paranoid while shopping, and
finished "Kentucky Route Zero." (KRZ) Kentucky Route Zero is superb; after I
completed it, I saw it described as a game that's less about how you interact
with the magically realistic Kentucky, but about how you feel about the
predicaments imposed on the varied and well-written characters. It's not at
all a difficult game, but it is absolutely brilliant.

Through this first week of lockdown, the pre-release reviews for New Horizons
went out of control;
the promise of being able to virutally visit your friends' "homes" and interact
with characters in a relaxed non-threatening cartoon was *really* appealing
in a world without "dining out" or "bars." Obviously, I had to give "Warframe"
a shot.

I didn't dislike Warframe while I played it, but the ramp from
the tutorial missions into the opening of the game and the funnel into paying
for stuff kind of wigged me out since I was playing pretty late on March 19,
2020 and knew I shouldn't be buying a bunch of content for a game I was mostly
playing on a whim in the remaining hours before New Horizons. It might've been
an enjoyable experience to get into the flow and rhythm of it, but that didn't
happen.

# Actually Getting Into Animal Crossing: New Horizons

I waited until after work on launch day to actually get in to ACNH. It's been
a year, so I don't actually remember it super well, but I do remember enjoying
it, but at the same time, the first-day content runs out after a few hours,
leaving you without much to do except shake trees. As your first week
progresses, new stuff becomes an option each day.

An experience I thoroughly enjoyed was the shared experience of starting the
game at the same time as everyone, and kind of learning bits and pieces about
the game organically.
I remember visiting an
acquaintance's island, and he gave me the ladder and vaulting pole because I
hadn't realized you'd have to buy stuff to navigate.

One of the features I spent a lot of time with in that first period was the
"Mystery Island Tour." It's hard to explain without actually talking about
what Animal Crossing even is, so&hellip;

# What is Animal Crossing?

Animal Crossing is a series of games in which you live in a small village,
maybe with a few other humans, and with up to ten animals. There's not
much that you have to do, but you're encouraged to make friends with your
neighbors, grow flowers, plant trees, furnish (and at notable expense,
upgrade) your house, decorate the island, and catch bugs and fish for your
village's museum.

The game runs on a real time clock and calendar,
which means that some
activities can only be done once a day, fish and bugs and weather may or
may not appear at a given time of day or during a given month, and some
things you might want to do will take days, or weeks, or months.

The quick description might be that it's a relaxing game
about delayed gratification
and being a good neighbor.

New Horizons sets your village on an island. You start off in a tent, the
island has a single kind of fruit and a couple kinds of flower growing
on it. In my case, I had cherry trees, cosmos flowers on the main central
island, and windflowers in the hills. You also have two random neighbors;
mine were [Fuchsia](https://nookipedia.com/wiki/Fuchsia), a fuchsia-colored
doe, and [Sprocket](https://nookipedia.com/wiki/Sprocket), a robot ostrich.

The first week of growing your island involves collecting bugs and fish
and donating them to
Tom Nook (the racoon bureaucrat), and eventually Blathers (an owl who
serves as the museum
curator); selling stuff (fruits, sticks, bugs & fish that the museum already
has, basically anything) to Timmy & Tommy (raccoon shopkeepers); and eventually
the options for stuff to buy or build at a workbench really opens up. This
runs in conflict with the daily limitations of life on your island. A tree only
fruits every three days, you can only get so many rocks and iron, and there's
only so much you can buy after selling bugs and fish.

The way the game addresses this is by adding "Mystery Island Tours," which
take you on an airplane ride to an instanced island that has trees, flowers,
and occasionally a few other interesting occurrences. In the early weeks of the
game, the legend of "Rancho Island" circulated.

Most of the bugs in Animal Crossing are harmless. The man-faced stinkbug can't
hurt you, but tarantulas and scorpions will send you to your front door or the
airplane you flew in on if you don't know exactly how to be careful after dark.
However, this minor risk pays off, since these bugs are worth up to
50 times what a less-venomous bug would be. *Hypothetically,* if there was an
entire Mystery Island full of tarantulae ("ranchos"), you could make a lot of
progress paying for your next house upgrade.

This is of course entirely hypothetical for me, since I've visited and
clear-cut a hundred or so Mystery Islands, and never found Rancho Island. What
I have found are lots of wood, rocks, the full complement of fruits, and new
residents for any empty houses. I'm not killing entire evenings island hopping
like I did in the spring of 2020, but that's largely because the way the game
fits into my schedule has changed.

I visited Japan in 2018, and because the transit systems in and around Tokyo are
superb, it's easy to simply not notice that you've walked several miles until
your muscles, honed by a decade of desk work, start protesting. While enjoying
an espresso and a comfortable chair indoors at the Hakone Open-Air Museum,
I groused to a friend that I was
terribly sore, and he correctly diagnosed me as fat and out of shape.

Since that trip, I've started working out on a regular basis. First it was
just riding the recumbent bike for a half hour a couple times a week, then
it was five times a week, then it was with more time at higher resistances,
and once it became clear I wasn't going to be "going places" for a month or
two or twelve, it became seven days a week. On its own, it's pretty boring,
so I listen to a podcast, and play a game that doesn't have a lot of
language.
At first it was "Polytopia" on iPad, which is a Civilization-style game
that you can normallycomplete in a half hour or less, which I've been
playing on and off since 2015, because that's exactly what I want sometimes.

As the reality of no-travel started to settle in, I got "Trainz Simulator 2,"
also for iPad. It's a game in which you drive trains. It comes with a handful
of maps and missions, more are available for $2 per bundle, and the game is
janky, some of the paid content is busted, and it's been neglected since 2014.

After a couple weeks of that I realized I could just play ACNH
while on the stationary bike. I've been making good progress, both on the
fitness goals and my island.
