I remember when my friend Will got "Animal Crossing" for Gamecube. It looked
cool the first night, it looked cool a week later, but I got yelled at when
I asked to make a character and cut down a bunch of trees, because Will had
to listen to Mr. Resetti gripe about Will rolling back my changes the
fast way. It seemed cute, but I wasn't at Will's enough to find any fulfillment
from his copy, and I wasn't planning on buying a Gamecube.

For like eighteen years after that I'd hear about Animal Crossing occasionally,
see one of their characters throw down against a generic anime swordhaver in
Smash Bros., but I didn't really have any interest in a Nintendo DS or Wii.

When I lived with Will, and he got "The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild"
(BOTW)
for Wii U, I watched him play a bunch and lucked into getting a Switch for that
game (which is perfect, wish I could play it for the first time again).
Another benefit of living with Will was getting to use his gaming PC to play
"Doom" (the 2016 version that I refer to as "Doom 4"), which is also perfect.

From 2017 through 2019, on Switch, I
ended up with
"Mario Kart 8 Deluxe" (good, dreading the day I have to destroy
a nephew or niece in it),
"Splatoon 2" (keep reading!),
"Golf Story" (it's alright, the golfing got too hard for my
patience),
and a few other games in 2017. Through 2018 and 2019 I played *a lot* of
Splatoon 2, and quite a few single-player games, often while traveling.
I deleted a trans-Atlantic trip with "Dead Cells," and trans-Pacific
flights with "Celeste," "Night in the Woods," and "Shovel Knight." I tried
the "Dark Souls" port and hated it.
I played through "Super Mario Odyssey" over the course of a few weekends and
found it brilliant. Once you beat the big boss and get the credits roll, the
set of new goals that was hinted at throughout unlock and the real game
begins.

A lot of people I chat with online were lamenting the simultaneous
announcements
(at the end of a fiscal quarter, thinking emoji) that "Doom Eternal" and
"Animal Crossing: New Horizons" ("New Horizons" or "ACNH")
would be pushed back to 2020, and I was a bit
sad but it's not like I was going to bother with a gaming PC or an
Animal Crossing game so whatever.

But "New Horizons" kept coming up in conversation. Outside a film
screening in February 2020, I got in a conversation about if this new virus
would make it to the US, but another person changed the topic to if
Tom Nook (the racoon bureaucrat) is a villain for immediately and repeatedly
putting you into debt, or benign for giving you a home with no strict
obligation to pay for the privilege.

I went on a business trip March 9, 2020. Through the course of the week,
the news got pretty grim pretty quickly. First, the Starbucks near the
destination banned personal cups. Then, my coworkers decided they needed
to rush home while they still could. The meeting ended with a dire warning to
tell the project owners if we did get symptoms in the coming weeks.

Finally, while I was waiting for my bag back in Miami, the TV news was saying
that the (completely dog shit) mayor got COVID from Bolsonaro's visit.

The week after that was weird. I first made a mask out of a T-shirt, bought
some masks, did some woodworking, was very paranoid while shopping, and
finished "Kentucky Route Zero," which is absolutely brilliant and you simply
must play it.

Through all of this, the pre-release reviews for New Horizons
went out of control;
the promise of being able to virutally visit your friends' "homes" and interact
with characters in a relaxed non-threatening cartoon was *really* appealing
in a world without "dining out" or "bars." Obviously, I had to give "Warframe"
a shot.

I didn't dislike Warframe while I played it, but the ramp from
the tutorial missions into the opening of the game and the funnel into paying
for stuff kind of wigged me out since I was playing pretty late on March 19,
2020 and knew I shouldn't be buying a bunch of content for a game I was mostly
playing on a whim in the remaining hours before New Horizons.
