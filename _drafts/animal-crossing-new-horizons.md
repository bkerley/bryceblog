I remember when my friend Will got "Animal Crossing" for Gamecube. It looked
cool the first night, it looked cool a week later, but I got yelled at when
I asked to make a character and cut down a bunch of trees, because Will had
to listen to Mr. Resetti gripe about Will rolling back my changes the
fast way. It seemed cute, but I wasn't at Will's enough to find any fulfillment
from his copy, and I wasn't planning on buying a Gamecube.

For like eighteen years after that I'd hear about Animal Crossing occasionally,
see one of their characters throw down against a generic anime swordhaver in
Smash Bros., but I didn't really have any interest in a Nintendo DS or Wii.

When I lived with Will, and he got "The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild"
(BOTW)
for Wii U, I watched him play a bunch and lucked into getting a Switch for that
game (which is perfect, wish I could play it for the first time again).
Another benefit of living with Will was getting to use his gaming PC to play
"Doom" (the 2016 version that I refer to as "Doom 4"), which is also perfect.

From 2017 through 2019, on Switch, I
ended up with
"Mario Kart 8 Deluxe" (good, dreading the day I have to destroy
a nephew or niece in it),
"Splatoon 2" (keep reading!),
"Golf Story" (it's alright, the golfing got too hard for my
patience),
and a few other games in 2017. Through 2018 and 2019 I played *a lot* of
Splatoon 2, and quite a few single-player games, often while traveling.
I deleted a trans-Atlantic trip with "Dead Cells," and trans-Pacific
flights with "Celeste," "Night in the Woods," and "Shovel Knight." I tried
the "Dark Souls" port and hated it.
I played through "Super Mario Odyssey" over the course of a few weekends and
found it brilliant. Once you beat the big boss and get the credits roll, the
set of new goals that was hinted at throughout unlock and the real game
begins.

A lot of people I chat with online were lamenting the simultaneous
announcements
(at the end of a fiscal quarter, thinking emoji) that "Doom Eternal" and
"Animal Crossing: New Horizons" ("New Horizons" or "ACNH")
would be pushed back to 2020, and I was a bit
sad but it's not like I was going to bother with a gaming PC or an
Animal Crossing game so whatever.

But "New Horizons" kept coming up in conversation. Outside a film
screening in February 2020, I got in a conversation about if this new virus
would make it to the US, but another person changed the topic to if
Tom Nook (the racoon bureaucrat) is a villain for immediately and repeatedly
putting you into debt, or benign for giving you a home with no strict
obligation to pay for the privilege.

I went on a business trip March 9, 2020. Through the course of the week,
the news got pretty grim pretty quickly. First, the Starbucks near the
destination banned personal cups. Then, my coworkers decided they needed
to rush home while they still could. The meeting ended with a dire warning to
tell the project owners if we did get symptoms in the coming weeks.

Finally, while I was waiting for my bag back in Miami, the TV news was saying
that the (completely dog shit) mayor got COVID from Bolsonaro's visit.

The week after that was weird. I first made a mask out of a T-shirt, bought
some masks, did some woodworking, was very paranoid while shopping, and
finished "Kentucky Route Zero." (KRZ) Kentucky Route Zero is superb; after I
completed it, I saw it described as a game that's less about how you interact
with the magically realistic Kentucky, but about how you feel about the
predicaments imposed on the varied and well-written characters. It's not at
all a difficult game, but it is absolutely brilliant.

Through this first week of lockdown, the pre-release reviews for New Horizons
went out of control;
the promise of being able to virutally visit your friends' "homes" and interact
with characters in a relaxed non-threatening cartoon was *really* appealing
in a world without "dining out" or "bars." Obviously, I had to give "Warframe"
a shot.

I didn't dislike Warframe while I played it, but the ramp from
the tutorial missions into the opening of the game and the funnel into paying
for stuff kind of wigged me out since I was playing pretty late on March 19,
2020 and knew I shouldn't be buying a bunch of content for a game I was mostly
playing on a whim in the remaining hours before New Horizons. It might've been
an enjoyable experience to get into the flow and rhythm of it, but that didn't
happen.

# Actually Getting Into Animal Crossing: New Horizons

I waited until after work on launch day to actually get in to ACNH. It's been
a year, so I don't actually remember it super well, but I do remember enjoying
it, but at the same time, the first-day content runs out after a few hours,
leaving you without much to do except shake trees. As your first week
progresses, new stuff becomes an option each day.

An experience I thoroughly enjoyed was the shared experience of starting the
game at the same time as everyone, and kind of learning bits and pieces about
the game organically.
I remember visiting an
acquaintance's island, and he gave me the ladder and vaulting pole because I
hadn't realized you'd have to buy stuff to navigate.

One of the features I spent a lot of time with in that first period was the
"Mystery Island Tour." It's hard to explain without actually talking about
what Animal Crossing even is, so&hellip;

# What is Animal Crossing?

Animal Crossing is a series of games in which you live in a small village,
maybe with a few other humans, and with up to ten animals. There's not
much that you have to do, but you're encouraged to make friends with your
neighbors, grow flowers, plant trees, furnish (and at notable expense,
upgrade) your house, decorate the island, and catch bugs and fish for your
village's museum.

The game runs on a real time clock and calendar,
which means that some
activities can only be done once a day, fish and bugs and weather may or
may not appear at a given time of day or during a given month, and some
things you might want to do will take days, or weeks, or months.

The quick description might be that it's a relaxing game
about delayed gratification
and being a good neighbor.

New Horizons sets your village on a desert island.
