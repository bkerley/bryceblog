[Codl](https://chitter.xyz/@codl), an e-friend on Mastodon,
had a question about how clam count indicators
worked in Splatoon 3 Clam Blitz:

<p class="content-note">splat 3</p>

<p>there&#39;s two different treatments for those clam count indicators and I don&#39;t understand what they mean exactly</p><p>like at first glance it seems like the coloured indicator goes to whomever has most clams, but i have seen counterexamples</p>

There's some important context for 
why I found this question really interesting.

# What is Splatoon?

Splatoon is a series of third-person shooters from Nintendo.
You play a kid, sometimes a squid[^octo],
rendered with considerable artistic license,
either locked in a solo or 
player-vs-enemy (PvE) existential
struggle of some sort,
or a player-vs-player contest for fun and in-game prizes.
Players can walk 
and shoot ink out of cartoonish weapons
(many like repurposed real-world gadgets)
XXXX ballpoint splatling goes here XXXX
in kid form,
swim and re-up on ink in squid form,
and return to the spawn point after being
blasted with too much opponent ink 
("splatted," not killed) in ghost form.

[^octo]: or an octopus

In each stage (map), most floors and some walls accept ink.
On un-inked ground, you can walk as a kid or
slowly push yourself in squid form.
You can walk fast and swim even faster in
friendly ink.
You take damage in opponents' ink, 
but can still move.
It's always valuable to spread ink
(from a gun, grenade, or special weapon)
where you or a teammate might want to move,
and your opponents are trying to do the same.

If you get too much opponents' ink on you
(either from their attacks or 
just from spending too much time in their ink)
you get "splatted" with a big pop, 
a surprised exclamation,
and a corona of their ink.
Outside of the PvE Salmon Run mode,
your ghost makes it back to your team's
end of the stage to respawn in a few seconds.

[^brushfast]: brushes let you run at 

Splatoon doesn't look like other 
big multiplayer shooters.
The inks are bright and vivid, splashy and wet.
Once you're in the thick of a
match,
an incredible amount of activity to keep track of,
because matches only last a few minutes and
even when you're passing through uncontested territory
you have to pay attention to the goal of the current game mode.

The unranked[^unranked] "Turf War" mode is straightforward: 
the team that's got more of the floor in their ink 
at the end of three minutes wins.

[^unranked]: it's absolutely tracking how good you are,
    just not giving you a visible rank to fret about

There are four ranked[^anarchy] modes too.
"Splat Zones" require teams to keep one or more
of the z0nes on the map in their color for a period of time.
"Tower Control" require teams to stand on a mobile tower 
to move it into the opponents' base to win.
"Rainmaker" is football (either kind) but the football is
a slow-charging bazooka you deliver to the opponents'
goal to win.

XXXX is there an official clam blitz explainer? XXXX

And finally, "Clam Blitz" is complicated.
Teams gather clams from around the stage.
When a player has enough 
(ten in Splatoon 2, eight in Splatoon 3)
they form a "power clam."
Once a power clam is in play, 
the goal is to put it in the opponents'
basket, breaking the barrier.
With the barrier down, 
attackers can throw
any clams (including power clams) in for points.
After a while, the barrier goes back up,
and the team defending it gets a free power clam.
There's a complex 
[ebb and flow](https://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/Ebb_%26_Flow)
to it, an extra layer of chaos to an already frantic game.

[^anarchy]: in Splatoon 3 the battles that establish a
    meritocratic hierarchy among players 
    are called "Anarchy Battles"
    
# Interface Design and Human Factors


XXXX ink tank images XXXX

You can categorize the way action games
communicate state to the player based on diegesis.
Seeing your ink tank empty on your octolings' back
is as diegetic as
[The Dude's Credence tapes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjBBDJ5OiT0).
It's part of the same world the characters inhabit.
Watching it refill as a UI element vaguely tethered
to your swimming form is non-diegetic,
much as
["The Blue Danube"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZoSYsNADtY)
isn't actually playing among spaceships in hard vacuum.

Splatoon uses both of these.
When it's viable to do so, 
state's diegetic.
Splat zones get highlighting around the edges 
XXXX do they?
when they change control,
the tower and the rainmaker are both physical objects
(and they can hurt you),
and once you've picked up clams they follow you around in a little line.
However, it's not always viable, 
and some parts of the game rate non-diegetic UI.
The tower, rainmaker, and power clams get 
a permanent overlaid icon on your screen
no matter how far away they are.

This presents a problem.
Splatoon 2 and 3 are for the Nintendo Switch,
which ships with a 720p (1280x720)
screen on the unit itself.
The more expensive versions of the hardware
(the original and OLED switches, not the lite switch)
can dock to drive a 1080p (1920x1080) screen, 
but the design of the game *has* to work at 720p on a 5.5" screen.
This puts a real damper on what you can show UI-wise.
Elements have to be big to work at 5.5", 
but too many of them won't leave enough room 
to notice an opponent casting ripples as they swim in their team's ink.

This has parallels with aviation.
In the [July/August 2020 issue of the FAA Safety Briefing][faa-brief],
the article "Avoiding Information Overload" by Gene Trainor (PDF page 36) 
mentions how non-diegetic[^htaws-diegesis] interfaces can cause problems:

> For example, Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B), 
> Helicopter Terrain Awareness and Warning Systems (HTAWS), 
> and autopilot technologies have made flying easier and safer. 
> The drawback is that these systems require concentration 
> when quick decisions are needed.

[faa-brief]: https://www.faa.gov/newsroom/safety-briefing/faa-safety-briefing-julyaugust-2020

[^htaws-diegesis]: you could absolutely make the argument that
    because these systems and interfaces inhabit our world,
    that they are in fact diegetic,
    but i couldn't think of a better terminology to use

The solution for this,
as implemented on the Boeing 777 and
[described by Vincent Czaplyski in AOPA Pilot magazine][aopa-cas]
is a Crew Alerting System (CAS) that filters and prioritizes warnings:

> Just the right touch, however, and the crew's situational awareness will be maximized, which is what warning systems are really all about. For this reason, some non-critical alerts on the 777 are inhibited at the beginning of the takeoff roll until the aircraft has reached a safe altitude. This is to prevent pilots from initiating high-speed aborted takeoffs for minor problems that could be easily taken care of once safely airborne.
>
> [‚Ä¶]
> 
> What happens if two or more critical conditions are detected simultaneously? CAS will issue alerts in a predetermined priority sequence. 
> [‚Ä¶]
> Shortly after takeoff, GPWS senses that your aircraft has begun to sink toward rising terrain. At the same time, the reactive wind shear warning system detects that the twinjet has encountered a microburst, just as the right engine catches on fire. To make matters worse, another aircraft is approaching on a collision course, something which causes TCAS to generate a resolution advisory (RA), warning of the traffic conflict.
> [‚Ä¶]
> According to Boeing spokesman Brian Kelly, voice warnings will sound in quick succession for wind shear, GPWS, and TCAS, in that order. While this is happening, the engine fire will trigger a fire bell and an EICAS text message simultaneously.

Competitive action games can absolutely put you at or beyond
the limits of your ability to process and act on information.
That's why they're fun!
However, 
presenting that fun to a wide variety of players
with a huge range of skill levels
requires careful consideration of
how information is communicated to players.

## Skill and Getting Clowned On

I'm 40, mostly play while also doing cardio, and I'm A-rank.
I've played matches where I get absolutely clowned on
(first day of the sweet/spicy/sour splatfest),
and I remember joining a friend on his first day in Splatoon 2
and worrying I was doing that to a bunch of literal children
(the game's rated for 10-and-up).


https://kitty.town/@kelly/109119890705163804 RIP reflexes post XXXX

I don't like to be clowned on of course,
occasionally clowning on a team can be fun,
but I've been spending more time in ranked
modes recently because it's less common,
and if you are getting clowned on, 
the match ends sooner.
I'd rather lose a ranked match than
suffer the last half of a turf war 
where the midfield is as distant as the moon.

# Clam Discs

Going back to the original Clam Blitz thing,
as players get their hands on clams, 
sometimes non-diegetic numbers show up above them,
sometimes dark/de-emphasized 
and someimes bright and vivid.
We wanted to figure out what caused the
numbers to show up, in which flavor.
That probably required two people on the same team,
and someone on the opponent team.

experiment design

So that's what we did! 
Splatoon 3 lets you set up a "private battle"
in which you're not bound by the game's schedule
or matchmaking.
Among the different game modes there is a "recon" option,
which configures the map and UI for a given mode,
but sets the timer out to an hour so you can
mess around and do whatever.
We went with clam blitz and recon at
Wahoo World.

wild hypotheses

hypothetical implementation

`FollowIcon` abstract class

subclasses implement `u8 priority()`; 
persistent stuff returns u8_max,
players with clams have to query game state, 
other players with clams,
doesn't necessarily update each frame

soft budgets for `FollowIcon`s,
low-priority ones may disappear,
high-priority ones may stick around,
hysteresis to keep them from flickering

# Conclusion

not a data miner but might be interesting to a
bored data miner that's also in UI design?

Thanks codl 
for nerd sniping me with this,
and ctrl-alt-dog/cinnamon
for helping out with the experiment.
