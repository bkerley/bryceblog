I went to [Toorcamp][toorcamp] this year!
I've been traveling to outdoor hacker camps every
year or so since 
[Chaos Communication Camp 2015][cccamp15],
although there was a gap while 
Toorcamp 2020 became Toorcamp 2022.

Since 2018, I've kind of wanted to turn the event into
an excuse to visit friends and do some US travel that's
not the brisk and strict point-to-point nature of air travel.

<div class="aside">

## But wait, what if you don't get a non-stop flight?

Airports aren't really a *place* per se, 
yeah they're a place but the nature of that place
is (sorry) *liminal*;
an airport is mostly just a bunch of hallways 
lined with (never enough) chairs, 
interchangeable lounges,
stores, and quick service kitchens.

I won't *not* have a [Mango Cart][mangocart] at 
the LAX AAdmiral's Club but let's not pretend it's
a Los Angeles experience, 
just a place to enjoy free wifi and a restroom where
you don't have to brace your forehead on the wall to fit.

</div>

Since I don't like driving, I decided to take
Amtrak.
And since I also had to work in July,
I only took it for part of the trip.
I'd fly to Seattle, do computer camp,
see some friends in town afterwards,
take the train south to visit a friend in
southern Washington,
continue south for what would hopefully
be a nice morning in Sacramento and not a stressful
connection,
then catch the California Zephyr first to Denver,
see more friends there over the weekend after Toorcamp,
get back on the Zephyr to Chicago,
and fly home from there.

# Miami to Toorcamp

</div>

I flew to Seattle,
spent an evening with Greg and Josh,
and the next day caught a ride with another
Toorcamp attendee.

The ferry ride was gorgeous; 
we were on the one that left right before sunset, 
and it was incredible to be sailing right into all the
spectacular colors.

Toorcamp was amazing as always.
Orcas Island, 
or at least the Doe Bay resort it's held at,
is spectacular.
It's the mostly wild Pacific Northwest,
with tall trees, complex terrain,
not-unfriendly fauna, 
and simply stunning summer weather,
with (to this Florida Man) cold nights and days that
may be anywhere from hot and sunny to
etheral and gloomy.
I got to see a bunch of friends, 
made some new ones,
leveled up my radio license,
and of course talked about computers a bit.

I'm also glad I snuck off a few times to 
just wander through a big garden, 
down to the shore where the seabirds frolicked
mostly free of people, 
and up through the woods to a quiet district
where a few people stayed in yurts.
As a fun chance encounter, 
while walking back to the main camp from 
the yurt zone, 
I had a quick conversation with
Annalee Newitz, 
an author whose books I've enjoyed 
and the event's keynote speaker.

All in, it was a super great event and 
I'm thinking about what to do for next time.

# Cascades and Starlight

<div class="photos mini right">

</div>

After spending a day in Seattle 
(shopping and visiting friends, of course),
I caught the Cascades line to south Washington.
The walk down to the station from my hotel wasn't too bad,
even if I was a bit overencumbered
with stuff I'd bought the previous day.
Since I wasn't going far,
I just got to enjoy breakfast and my morning games
(Wordle, among others).

My friend in south Washington lives somewhere mad rural;
on the drive to his place we got to see some funky
local landmarks,
like an indoor flea market that's
"open" but feels abandoned most days, 
a weird and possibly illegal event space,
a massive and ugly bird sculpture that's
*rumored* to contain a helicopter
(all of these are the *same place*).

It honestly made me think of rural Saskatchewan, 
but with stuff more concentrated due to terrain.
I had a ton of fun out there at the farm,
seeing chickens, shooting guns,
subjecting everyone to the bottle of
Jeppson's Mal√∂rt that I horked from Toorcamp.

The next morning, after breakfast, I went back to
town to catch the Coast Starlight south.
Unlike the Cascades line, 
the Starlight is a proper long-distance train,
with sleeper cars, sit down dining, an observation car,
the whole deal.
I had a roomette, since I was gonna be riding overnight,
and also computing a bunch.

The sleeper train experience is pretty nice, 
once you get over the bumps, 
the non-deterministic arrival schedule,
and unreliable cell service.
I'm not being ironic;
it's way more spacious than anything in the skies,
you can get up and walk around,
and every few hours there's a "smoke break"
where you can get off the train for a bit.

The roomette is pretty good too.
You get two chairs that face each other and recline,
wider than US first class airplane seats. 
You get power and a huge window.
There's an easy bed to get in to, 
made by reclining the two seats together.
There's a difficult bed that pulls down from the
ceiling, 
and on the Superliner trains it's nice and dark up there too.

</div>

The Starlight has a substantial smoke break
in Portland, which is a gorgeous station;.
South of there, 
coincidentally when I was getting dinner,
it passes Odell Lake,
which another passenger at the table commented
was "more trees than [they'd] ever seen in [their] life!"
Over lunch I'd had the meyer lemon cake for dessert, 
so with dinner I decided to get the chocolate cheesecake, 
which was super rich and dense.

We were expected in Sacramento at, like, 6:30am
the next day, 
and by the time I finished dinner we were still on time
(outlier)
so I set my alarm for 6am, 
got everything I wouldn't need in the morning packed,
and made it an early night.

# Sacramento

Nobody told me I'd have a fun time in Sacramento.
Getting out of the train station at 6:30
(checked everything at the luggage counter except 
my wallet, phone, and rented camera)
was interesting. It felt like much of the town hadn't woken up,
and while the train station was pretty close to the capitol,
Downtown Sacramento doesn't have a lot going on for
visitors at 7am.

</div>

I'd looked around online and found
[Milka Coffee Roasters][milka], 
a coffee shop about a mile walk away, so I set out.
I got there a few seconds before the barista did,
but I did enjoy legit one of the best espressos I've
ever had, 
a maple latte which was also great, and a muffin.

After that, I set off again, wandered around the Capitol
building, and decided to see if anything was open in
the Old Sacramento tourist district.
The train museum wasn't, 
but trains are big and they were pretty easy to see from outside.
A little diner was, 
so I had a more substantial breakfast while sitting outside.
After that, I walked over the river 
mostly for the sake of filling the ring on my watch,
and headed back to the station way earlier than necessary.

# California Zephyr, Above Denver

<div class="photos mini left">

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/bonzoesc/52380990816/in/datetaken/" title="Zephyr Bedroom Selfie"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52380990816_37e5e5848d_c.jpg" width="600" height="800" alt="I'm wearing basketball shorts and a black t-shirt in a small room, with a bunch of stuff on the sofa behind me"></a>

</div>

The California Zephyr is two things.
It's an absolute beast of a journey,
a 2400 mile trek from San Francisco[^sf] area to
Chicago, over 52 hours[^hours].
It's also a pretty typical Amtrak long-distance train,
with similar amenities to the Coast Starlight.

[^sf]: well, Oakland[^oak]
[^oak]: well, Emeryville
[^hours]: listed as 51h40m eastbound, 
    but you will not go that fast

This ride, I'd booked a full bedroom 
since it was the longest leg of the trip.
The bedroom's great. 
You get a chair, a big couch that folds down into a bed,
another bed that pulls out of the ceiling,
and a little private bathroom with both a toilet
and a shower.

The real reason to take the Zephyr is the scenery, 
especially through the Rockies 
between Grand Junction and Denver.
Most of the second day's route is along the Colorado River, 
through the mountains,
with people out on the water showing the whole train their
backside as tradition.
It was enjoyably busy on the river for a Friday afternoon,
and the scenery didn't disappoint.

<div class="photos mini right">

</div>

The conductor[^conductor], Brad, for this leg was fantastic too,
with tons of facts about the route and a great sense of
humor. 
A few times up in the mountains, 
we'd stop for a while to wait for a switch to move,
and at least once he stepped off the train to
wrangle it by hand.

[^conductor]: on Amtrak, the conductor is the main
    person for the passenger part of the operation,
    similar to a purser on an airplane or ship

A fun bit of trivia: the Zephyr passes through the
[Moffat Tunnel][moffat-wiki] in the Rockies,
a six-mile tunnel that's
the highest point on Amtrak's network,
and commences the train's descent into Denver, 
and basically Chicago.

[moffat-wiki]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moffat_Tunnel

Brad described it as, in some ways, the top of America,
and while it wasn't the emotional high point of my whole
trip[^emotional], 
it definitely marked, for me, the beginning of the
end of the odyssey.

[^emotional]: that would probably be celebrating
    after passing the radio test,
    having a really good whisky,
    or learning about how [Shadytel][shadytel] ran
    phone service to the upper camp in exchange for
    taking a good picture

[shadytel]: https://shady.tel/

I was going to spend a weekend in Denver, 
the top of America, where the 
romantic southwest transitions to
the cultural northwest and 
geographic midwest without
being threatening to people from the east.
I was going to see friends that had fled Miami
years prior for something that wasn't the
fast pace of the northeast,
the ethereal gloom of the northwest,
or California.
But after that I'd continue downhill towards
Chicago,
nothing more planned than a hotel reservation and an airplane
ticket.

According to Brad, the trackage west of Denver isn't
particularly well maintained by the freight railroad
that owns it,
and with modern summer heat,
they have to slow the train way down to avoid damaging it.
That meant that we got in to Denver hours late,
but the dinner on the train was so nice and my
plans for after arrival were so sparse I didn't mind.

# A Weekend in Denver

Earlier on Friday, I'd texted my friends in Denver.
A couple of them, said they were going to be busy
all day Saturday,
racing dragon boats at Sloan Lake, just west of downtown.
Another friend, Javi, was working Saturday but not Sunday.

So Saturday morning I woke up, washed up,
found a coffee place, and took the light rail out to
Sloan Lake to see if I could figure out where 
the dragons were.

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/bonzoesc/52307536565/in/datetaken/" title="Dragon Boats and a Brewing Storm"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52307536565_3641b89dd3_h.jpg" width="1600" height="1067" alt="Two long boats each rowed by dozens of people, a red one in the middle of the frame and a green one truncated on the left, two floats on the right, and rain clouds over the mountains in the background"></a>

After a hot but dry walk up the hill from the light rail, 
I found myself in a quiet but massive park, 
with what might be some activity at the far side of the lake.
So I kept walking around the lake, and eventually got to 
a massive festival, with a bag check at the entrance,
tons of food vendors, multiple stages, 
an unusably oversubscribed cell network,
and a bunch of different teams of racers, 
and I had no idea where my friends were!

I got a bottle of water, 
and found a spot that was alright for watching the races 
but top-notch for watching the racers getting on and
off the boats, 
and I found one of them pretty soon after that.
He (and the rest of the team that'd just won their race)
led me to their club's tent where his wife was,
and we hung out in the shade and shelter from the 
itinerant afternoon rain, 
enjoying spam musubi and fun company.
I met a few other people that were spectating
and talked a lot about Toorcamp,
but eventually as it stayed hot yet drizzly,
we split up for the afternoon, 
although I did get an invitation and an offered ride
to what ended being a fun and relaxing backyard
cookout that evening.

The next morning I went to a very busy but pretty good
breakfast place (got the huevos rancheros)
before checking out at the hotel and
dropping my bags at Union Station.
From there, 
I caught the train east out to suburban big box hell,
and walked from there to Station 26 Brewing.
We hung out for a few hours, 
had some brews and listened to the band.
We then made our way across town to 
Epic Brewing, in an area that didn't seem unlike Wynwood.
After a drink there, 
we went to a neat basement ramen shop, 
and then he dropped me off back at Union Station.

Of course I was still thinking in airport timing, 
and I had about ninety minutes to kill at the station.
I developed photos from the busy day,
had a manhattan from the bar right there in the waiting room,
and eventually moseyed outside to get on the train.

# California Zephyr, Below Denver

</div>

Out on the platform, 
there was a big queue before the train even pulled up,
next to a private railcar I hadn't noticed Friday.
I walked around the gathering
to get some photos of the train pulling in,
and when it did, 
the conductor yelled at me from a window to get in the line.
Back in the line,
we got to watch the back end of a private car pull in,
and once that was uncoupled, 
people started streaming off the train 
just as I had Friday night.
A few minutes later, we started piling on.

I was looking forward to going to bed,
and my roomette was already set up for it.
Chairs merged, mattress and sheets in place;
all I had to do was figure out how to share
the space with my bags and get over the 
subtle but persistent aroma I hadn't noticed in
any of the previous rooms I'd been in.

After rigging up the coat strap to 
keep everything stowed in a sensible way,
I slept alright.

Riding down into Chicago the next day was pretty relaxed.
The view is mostly corn, so I got lots of computing in.
It was kind of neat going through places that 
I either think of as punchlines for jokes or
not at all, but mostly in a checklist kind of way.
Omaha? Checked off.


# Chicago

<div class="photo center">
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/bonzoesc/52307530810/in/datetaken/" title="Rapidly Approaching Chicago"><img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52307530810_d5577706c4_6k.jpg" width="6000" height="4000" alt="The distant Chicago skyline stands tall beyond a helicopter and the motion blurred train tracks"></a>
</div>

It was great to pull in to Chicago on Monday evening.
I'd enjoyed the ride, 
but real life responsibilities hadn't been on vacation with me.
The need to finish a work project had been building up,
the side project I'd been working on was drawing close,
and I missed people from home too.

I was pretty glad I wasn't trying to catch the
8pm flight to Miami, 
because that's when the train arrived.
Instead I'd booked a hotel downtown for the night,
and I enjoyed a second shower of the day,
a $26 Manhattan back downstairs in the lobby
(c'mon that is ridiculous), 
and a king size bed that didn't wobble around.

Before heading out to O'Hare,
I got some amazing huevos rancheros at "Eggy's,"
enjoyed some of the weird terrain and elevation
around there (climbed a big staircase after breakfast),
and finally figured out how to get on the Blue Line.

The last train ride of the trip was neat; 
it was after rush hour, 
so for most of the ride the real hustle and bustle
of the car was a guy taking a few kids to the airport,
trying to teach the oldest how to play rock-paper-scissors.
At the airport, I waited around while listening
to a family on their way to the Orlando theme parks
while ordering DEF CON supplies.

# Miami

The rest of the trip home was honestly kind of a blur!
More distance than the ride the previous day,
in a fraction of the time. 
I didn't even bother with the big computer,
instead watching a video on my tablet 
and enjoying a beer.
The trip from the airport back home was similarly
quick,
and all I could think of to do once I got there 
was throw my stuff down and 
immediately go walk for groceries,
in the heat and humidity.

For me, that's kind of how many of these trips end;
amazing times with friends I miss,
the blur of travel,
and after that a quick transition to rejoin the
world I feel obliged to pay attention to.
The fascinating and memorable part of 
this particular experience
was that the bulk of the trip was memorable, 
to an extent.
While the train is primarily a mode of transport,
it's similar to a Caribbean cruise 
in that the mode of transport is 
contemplatively slow enough that it becomes as much
a goal of the trip instead of simply a facility.

Will I do it again?
I could absolutely see doing this trip 
or something similar for a future Toorcamp,
and I'm absolutely not opposed to taking Amtrak
to DC or somewhere like that again either.
It's not great if you've got a schedule,
but for leisure travel, 
sometimes you'd rather not have a schedule.
