I don't necessarily stand behind the older posts here anymore, but I don't
think they
should be lost forever.

Some of these may have broken code or busted formatting. [Let me know if you
notice one like that][email]; I don't want to rewrite anything, but fixing
stuff is fair game.

Some of the very old ones have broken images; I'm still trying to find them.

A lot of external links are probably broken. I'm not necessarily opposed to
fixing them.
