{% raw %}<p>Tried the latest Web 2.0 buzzword-compliant browser &ldquo;Flock&rdquo; today.  It&rsquo;s kind of tough and carbonized around the edges, like chili that wasn&rsquo;t stirred enough. Missed the library at school by 10 minutes, wanted to get a book, but they were all closed up.<br/></p>{% endraw %}

{% raw %}<p>And then I was turning on the Xbox to watch a movie and somehow the knee of my shorts got ripped.  Shoppin&rsquo; tomorrow I guess :/<br/></p>{% endraw %}
