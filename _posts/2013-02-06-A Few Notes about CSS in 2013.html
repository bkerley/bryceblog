{% raw %}<ul><li>Web fonts are nice to have, most of your viewers should be able to see things mostly the same way you designed them.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s cool to not care about Internet Explorer. It&rsquo;s even cooler knowing that it&rsquo;ll get things mostly right.</li>
<li>Media queries: if you&rsquo;re designing for smartphones and tablets, you can take a few steps to make the page a bit more usable. If you&rsquo;re designing for overhead projectors universities bought a decade ago, you can take huge steps to re-layout a normal 960px page.</li>
<li>Making your site work on a narrow projector is easy when you can swap out your standard font for a condensed font.</li>
<li>SASS is still the best.</li>
