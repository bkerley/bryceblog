{% raw %}<p>Things look different around here.</p>{% endraw %}

{% raw %}<p>Mephisto was kind of hard to tweak and hack on, because of its heritage as both a weblog and CMS for people who might not necessarily know how to write webapps.  Hence the complicated theme system, liquid plugins, &c. that exist to make it usable for a wide audience.  However, this made it strange and unfamiliar to me.</p>{% endraw %}

{% raw %}<p>This is &ldquo;chronicle&rdquo;, hacked together from scratch in not much time.  I&rsquo;m not open-sourcing it for now because it&rsquo;s seriously basically the barest-bones possible weblog system you can write in Rails, without any useful features like Atom feeds or publishing support.</p>{% endraw %}

{% raw %}<p>It also doesn&rsquo;t support comments.  Suck on that, spambots.  If you want to comment, just email me (and get past the filter).</p>{% endraw %}
