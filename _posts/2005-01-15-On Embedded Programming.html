{% raw %}<p>My brother is building a robot that will navigate around areas on its own, eventually being able to map out its surroundings in memory.  To achieve this, he&rsquo;s using a Brainstem robot controller hooked to a PocketPC 2003 machine in an autonomous unit.</p>{% endraw %}

{% raw %}<p>The problems come when setting up the MS eMbedded Visual C++ environment to be able to compile programs that both run on the PocketPC and use the Brainstem libraries (for the correct CPU and everything).  The whole EVC++ program has such a sad and terrible interface that I can&rsquo;t make heads or tails of it, especially with the subpar Brainstem documentation.</p>{% endraw %}

{% raw %}<p>Not trying to sound smarmy here, but when there&rsquo;s no easy &ldquo;just let me compile it myself I want it to be a console program and not some retarded wizard&rsquo;s robe and hat garbage&rdquo; option, it scares people away!</p>{% endraw %}

{% raw %}<p>Just starting a project, here&rsquo;s what the source file looks like: 
<img src="/textpattern/images/15.png" title="MS Embedded C   example" alt="MS Embedded C example"/></p>{% endraw %}

{% raw %}<p>OK, that&rsquo;s a huge mess.  It&rsquo;s workable, once we set up the includes.</p>{% endraw %}

{% raw %}<p>Let&rsquo;s see, nope, there&rsquo;s no easy to do that either.</p>{% endraw %}

{% raw %}<p>So I did what any older brother would do: sent my brother to somebody who might possibly know. :)</p>{% endraw %}
