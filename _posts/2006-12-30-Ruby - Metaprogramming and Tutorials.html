{% raw %}<p>I caught/am catching <a href="http://www.joshstaiger.org/archives/2006/12/metaprogramming.html">Josh Staigler&rsquo;s series</a> (that&rsquo;s the third part, the prior two parts are linked in the first paragraph) on some Ruby hackin&rsquo; and metaprogrammin&rsquo;, and would just like to recommend it to anybody interested.  Neither of us is a guru like <a href="http://redhanded.hobix.com">why</a> or <a href="http://eigenclass.org/">Mauricio</a>, but it&rsquo;ll be a neat intro for any curious newbies (the best kind of newbie).</p>

<p>In the same spirit of things (and the belated spirit of Christmas, ho ho ho), I&rsquo;ve gone ahead and added the PDFs to the notes from the section of Ruby I taught in Dr. Albrecht&rsquo;s Programming Languages class at USF in the fall of 2006.  <a href="http://brycekerley.net/RubyTut/">Scope the folder full of all the files</a>, or hit <a href="http://brycekerley.net/RubyTut/revised.pdf">Intro to Ruby</a> (last compiled on my birthday!) and <a href="http://brycekerley.net/RubyTut/rubymeta.pdf">Ruby: Behind the Eightball</a> separately.</p>

<p>The source code in that folder&rsquo;s kind of disorganized, so here&rsquo;s a quick run down:</p>

<ul><li><p>Most of the standalone .rb files are just that â€“ standalone examples referenced in either revised.pdf (Intro to Ruby) or rubymeta.pdf (Ruby: Behind the Eightball).</p></li>
<li><p>carpark-nohead.rb is probably out of date against carpark.rb .  The only difference was that carpark-nohead.rb had, get this, no header so it wouldn&rsquo;t take up too much v-space when included in a LaTeX document.</p></li>
<li><p>The .rb files in the filetypes directory are automatically loaded by commentscan.rb (which will fail due to the way tex.rb works) and commentscan-ext.rb (which is a true superset of commentscan&rsquo;s functionality).  Usage for these is discussed in rubymeta.pdf .</p></li>
<li><p>The .tex files correspond to the .pdf files, save for intro.tex , which was basically an aborted early attempt that got its content mixed back into revised.pdf .</p></li>
</ul><p>Also, one final oddity from that class, is the award-winning <a href="http://brycekerley.net/lao/">Law & Order site</a>.</p>{% endraw %}
