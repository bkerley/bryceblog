{% raw %}<p>I was messing around with a project this week in Ruby, and right as I was trying to figure out how to best implement extensibility and modularity, <a href="http://eigenclass.org/hiki.rb?ruby+plugins">this article came along</a>.</p>

<p>Main module require&rsquo;d from main.rb:</p>

<pre><code>class Statement
  @@statementtypes = Array.new

  #implements plug-in nature of statements
  def self.inherited(stmttype)
    @@statementtypes << stmttype
  end
end

Dir["statements/*.rb"].each do |x|
  load x
end
</code></pre>

<p>And each .rb file in statements/ has a class that inherits from Statement.</p>

<p>No details yet on what the project is, aside from that it&rsquo;s fun and challenging.</p>{% endraw %}
