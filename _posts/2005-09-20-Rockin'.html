{% raw %}<p>I&rsquo;ve been on a Beatles kick the past few days.  I really love everything they did post-Rubber Soul, and I think I can blame my parents for that.  One memory that stands out in particular from my childhood is learning the lyrics to Yellow Submarine from my dad who could play it on guitar.</p>{% endraw %}
