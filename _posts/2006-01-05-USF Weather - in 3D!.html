{% raw %}<p>I&rsquo;ve been working on preparing software to display weather information on a display in the NES building at school for the meteorology lab.  At first, I decided to play it safe and smash together a PHP script that did it without fanfare, but since I had some free time over the break, I went with something more interesting/educational:</p>{% endraw %}

{% raw %}<p><a href="/typo/files/usfweather01.png"><img src="/typo/files/usfweather01-th.png" alt="USF Weather display"/></a></p>{% endraw %}

{% raw %}<p>It fetches the maps and current conditions from the existing web server (they both change every few minutes, and the maps update seamlessly when they&rsquo;re not visible, causing no noticeable jerkiness), and zooms in and out on each of the maps in sequence.</p>{% endraw %}

{% raw %}<p>I&rsquo;ve been toying with the idea of adding a little compass rose or animated windsock to describe the wind speed, and maybe use some shader effects for other conditions.  Doing this pretty much requires the host machine to have a decent graphics card, so if I can&rsquo;t do it in the permanent display it&rsquo;ll still be something to show off at Engineering Expo.</p>{% endraw %}
