I played a lot of shareware Doom growing up, 
but I never really got into downloading maps online.
We only had one phone line, and as a result I didn't
have much of an on-ramp to online communities until
Doom had been disregarded in favor of newer and shinier
games.

<aside>
I'm going to be referring to "Doom" a lot here
as a short-hand for "classic" Doom.
To me, that means Doom 1, and stuff that's generally
considered part of the Doom 1 lineage,
like retail Doom 2 and Final Doom,
Chex Quest and Heretic,
the Eternity Engine and GZDoom source ports,
and
mods playable in such ports.
Not really Doom 3 or later.

And I'm not doing the all-caps thing either,
have some self-respect.
</aside>

Decades later, I found myself getting back in,
after seeing the review and a screenshot of
[Ancient Aliens][aaliens] in the
[2016 Cacowards][caco-2016]. 
This wasn't the greys and browns of my childhood,
but something new and vivid.
It was still Doom, 
but it wasn't afraid to be its own vision of Doom.
Same monsters[^aaliens-monsters],
but a new architecture, a new setting,
a new *vocabulary* of shooty game.

[^aaliens-monsters]: well, except for a couple new ones

[aaliens]: https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Ancient_Aliens
[caco-2016]: https://www.doomworld.com/23years/best1.php

I've spent way more time with Ancient Aliens
than Dooms 2016 or Eternal.
It launches faster, it's less involved,
and honestly it's a comfy experience
even though it's *weird* in a way that cannot be
commercially viable.

Since then I've played a handful of new wads[^wads]
every year. 
Some impressed the hell out of me, 
some I found boring or frustrating,
plenty just kind of middling,
but in general the modern vision of classic Doom is
a fast and fun shooter with an unimaginably vast
array of content that costs nothing beyond a tiny
bit of disk space and the joyful process of discovery.

[^wads]: Doom and mods traditionally came in `.WAD`
    files, which is Where All the Data are. 
    Some modern Doom content comes in `.pk3` files
    but whatever, they're wads in spirit.



# In Too Deep

I was introduced to [Time Tripper][timetrip] 
in a social space,
where a few of us were talking about wads we loved,
so I gave it a shot.

I struggled hard in an early playthrough!
The visual style early on 
isn't completely distinct from
[Eviternity][eviternity] or other
[OTEX][otex]-using work.
You get dumped in, 
and there are arch-viles 
(the one enemy that still has a ranged 
hitscan[^hitscan])
right there.
As you progress there are checkpoints for saving,
lulling you into a false sense of security
if you're a quicksave junkie.

[^hitscan]: an attack in a shooting game that
    operates as an instant scan to see if it hits,
    instead of existing as a visible and
    potentially dodge-able projectile in the world.
    In Doom 1, bullets and shotgun pellets are
    hitscan attacks, while rockets and fireballs
    are projectiles.

[eviternity]: https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Eviternity
[otex]: https://doomwiki.org/wiki/OTEX

If you're not a fan of the pistol start[^pistol-start]
(I'm not),
you might get frustrated when you change levels and
end up with the single shotgun instead of your
prior armament.

[^pistol-start]: when you start an episode in classic
    Doom you have 100% health and a pistol, 
    and as you progress through the episode,
    stuff you find carries over, 
    so if you find the rocket launcher in E1M3
    you can use it on the bosses in E1M8.
    If you play with pistol start rules, 
    you start every level with the pistol.

As I played a bit more,
I started to really enjoy 
how different it was from other Doom stuff.
While it has a similarly wild palette to
Ancient Aliens and others like it,
Time Tripper goes full GZDoom
with lighting effects and sky effects.
It has checkpoints in a few places,
(but I still quicksaved a bunch.)

I ended up doing multiple playthroughs;
the second was right after the first,
but on "Normal" difficulty instead of
"Light" like my first time through.
It's much less monstrous than Sunlust,
which was unplayable on UV[^uvmax] and
a struggle on HMP.
Normal is probably on par with
Ancient Aliens on UV?
I should replay both of those againâ€¦

[^uvmax]: [Doom has different skill levels.][skill]
    UV is "Ultra-Violence" which is hard,
    HMP is "Hurt Me Plenty" which is medium,
    and there's also "Nightmare!" 
    which isn't even remotely fair.

[skill]: https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Skill_level#Doom_and_Doom_II_skill_levels

My third play-through was
on "No Miss or Bust,"
where everything goes down in one shot.
It's fast, intense,
and only one spot felt unwinnable.

The secrets are good!
Some are useful tidbits,
some are amusing,
and some are huge changes to entire stages.

# The Restless, The Tender

The music in Time Tripper goes places.
Some tracks are an ambiance that breaks in to
an interesting melody.
Some tracks are psychedelia with a drill beat,
like if
[Terry Riley][rainbow-curved]
was your
*[Hard Normal Daddy][hard-normal]*.
More than one track has a vocal line. 
(I learned that GZDoom has a module player!)

[rainbow-curved]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Rainbow_in_Curved_Air
[hard-normal]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_Normal_Daddy

My favorite is possibly "The Forever Plane,"
which has some really interesting syncopation
going on.

I will caution you to not listen to the whole soundtrack
before playing, 
because it spoils something enjoyably surprising
late in the game.

# End

If you're Doom-curious,
I'd recommend Time Tripper 
after getting some familiarity with
Doom canon, Dooms 1 and 2 for sure,
but maybe Ancient Aliens as well.
I think Time Tripper hits harder with
an appreciation for what it changes up,
and it's *so good* that you want it to hit like that.

If you're a Doom connoisseur,
Time Tripper is hopefully something you've had a look at,
but if not, you will probably appreciate 
the sweeping changes from a more vanilla experience.

Time Tripper is available for free at
<https://heckscaper.com/tt/> . 
The instructions there are probably good for Windows users.
Linux and Mac people will probably want to 
plug their correct filesystem paths into something like:
```sh
/Applications/GZDoom.app/Contents/MacOS/gzdoom \
    -iwad ~/Sync/doom-wads/DOOM2.WAD \
    -file ~/Sync/doom-wads/pwads/timetrip/timetrip.pk3
```

The soundtrack's at
<https://lapfox.bandcamp.com/album/time-tripper-circuit01-abyssal>
to stream or download on a name your own price deal.
Again, it's worth holding off if you plan to play the game,
for spoiler reasons.
