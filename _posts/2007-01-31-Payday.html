{% raw %}<p>Last week I went to Massachusetts for work, spending the majority of the week in Taunton (closer to Providence than Boston).  I kind of got used to the work laptop I&rsquo;m using for now (Dell Latitude 820, quite fast but the trackpad is too small).  After returning to the normal office on Friday, I realized that my first week or two of pay would have gone through.</p>{% endraw %}

{% raw %}<p>So the first thing I did after work, hacking, and dinner was buy a 360 and Gears of War (and Geometry Wars), and after Psych Dustin and I played that for a few hours.</p>{% endraw %}

{% raw %}<p>Saturday the hackin&rsquo; gang got together to get some work pushed through on the secret project.  And also play a bit of Gears.</p>{% endraw %}

{% raw %}<p>Sunday I beat Gears, moved some leaves around in the back yard, and messed around with Gentoo on the work laptop (as of today it&rsquo;s running <a href="http://wmii.suckless.org/">wmii</a> with <a href="http://eigenclass.org/hiki.rb?wmii+ruby">wmii-ruby</a> firefox, vmware for that other OS).</p>{% endraw %}

{% raw %}<p>Life&rsquo;s good :)</p>{% endraw %}
