{% raw %}<p>The summer session&rsquo;s just over a week from being over, and I can&rsquo;t wait.  This friday is another hackin&rsquo; game, and after that I&rsquo;m going to try and get as much of my stuff as possible over to the new townhouse I&rsquo;ll be in for the next year (woop getting out of college slum).</p>

<p>Picture of the new kitchen:</p>

<p>My current kitchen would probably fit in the empty floor space there.  This one even has enough room for the old grape iMac next to the fridge (lookin&rsquo; up recipes hooray).  Well, once it boots with the 20gb drive successfully.</p>{% endraw %}
