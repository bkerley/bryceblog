<p>On a fossil-hunting trip with her family, five-year-old Daisy Morris found the remains of a previously undiscovered dinosaur, which is now named <em>Vertidraco daisymorrisae. </em>The new dino is not only a previously unknown species, but an unknown genus, making Daisy’s find a really big deal. It’s a pterosaur — a winged flying dino — about the size of a crow, which lived 115 million years ago. </p>

<p>Hell. Yes. You Go, Daisy Morris.</p></blockquote></p>
