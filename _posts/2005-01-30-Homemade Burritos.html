{% raw %}<p>I made some burritos for dinner tonight.</p>

<p>One green pepper
One onion
One stalk of celery
Package of lean ground beef</p>

<p>Brown the beef with the diced vegetables in a pan on the stove.</p>

<p>Add to taste (because I didn&rsquo;t measure)
Cumin
Paprika
Garlic
Chili Powder
Kosher Salt</p>

<p>After the onions are mostly limp but the green peppers haven&rsquo;t yet given up their stiffness (or maybe later, I&rsquo;ve only done this once), shut off the stove and serve on a tortilla with cheese.</p>{% endraw %}
