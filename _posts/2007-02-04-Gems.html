{% raw %}<p>I learned how to make Gems today.  So far, I&rsquo;ve made them for <a href="http://brycekerley.net/mp/2006/11/8/the-carpark">carpark</a> and <a href="http://brycekerley.net/mp/2007/1/11/httpal-ruby-http-client">HTTPal</a>.</p>{% endraw %}

{% raw %}<p>These gems are signed with my <a href="http://brycekerley.net/mp/about/gem-signing-key">gem-signing key </a>, which has never been signed by anybody to the best of my knowledge.</p>{% endraw %}

{% raw %}<p>Install these with:</p>{% endraw %}

{% raw %}<pre>
gem install HTTPal-16.gem
gem install Carpark-16.gem
</pre>{% endraw %}

{% raw %}<p><a href="http://brycekerley.net/assets/2007/2/3/HTTPal-16.gem">HTTPal-16.gem</a>
<a href="http://brycekerley.net/assets/2007/2/3/Carpark-16.gem">Carpark-16.gem</a></p>{% endraw %}

{% raw %}<p>Hopefully these will be on Rubyforge soon, and get updated more often, but until then, here they are.</p>{% endraw %}
