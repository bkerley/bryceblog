{% raw %}<p>I&rsquo;ve been out and about for most of the day - <a href="http://mystride.ytmnd.com/">ain&rsquo;t nothing gonna</a> <a href="http://darthstride.ytmnd.com">break my stride</a>.</p>{% endraw %}

{% raw %}<p>After approximating a shower and navigating the stairs this morning, I was off to Benjarong Thai with Dustin, who had been fiending for it all week since his birthday.  He had the usual (the waitress knew it), and I tried the Duck Panang, which was awesome.  We talked about a hackin&rsquo; project we&rsquo;re going to be working on soon, and also about Dustin&rsquo;s anti-duck-eating policy.</p>{% endraw %}

{% raw %}<p>Following that, we went to the hackin&rsquo; meeting, where Amin presented on Linux securty.  It was a good presentation, and led to some good discussion.  We also registered for a CTF coming up in December, and considered redrawing our logo for it.</p>{% endraw %}

{% raw %}<p>After the meeting ended, Andrew, Zap, April, RC, and I went to the Tampa Ale House for dinner becuase nobody made chili for Battlestar tonight.  Dinner was great, BSG was great, and all in all I can say I&rsquo;ve had worse days recently.</p>{% endraw %}

{% raw %}<p>From my moving around today, I think my knee&rsquo;s getting a bit better.  I can put a bit of weight on it comfortably to help me move around, something useful because I did a lot of crutchin&rsquo; today.</p>{% endraw %}
