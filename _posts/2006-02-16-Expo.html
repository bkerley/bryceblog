{% raw %}<p>Killer week - got most of the crazy cube wizard project for Operating Systems done (although if I ever see a wizard I&rsquo;m going to karate them), found out the database project that we&rsquo;ll be working on for the last half of the semester is a blank check, and did a quick hack on the metlab site.</p>{% endraw %}

{% raw %}<p>Engineerng Expo&rsquo;s tomorrow, and I don&rsquo;t really know how long I&rsquo;m going to be there either day, but I&rsquo;m pretty sure it&rsquo;ll be a long time.</p>{% endraw %}
