{% raw %}<p>Github now has an HTTPS repository URL for every project, and you should definitely use it. You don&rsquo;t have to manage SSH keys, just store your password in plain text<sup>1</sup> in your home directory.</p>{% endraw %}

{% raw %}<p>Once per machine, put this in your ~/.netrc file:</p>{% endraw %}

{% raw %}<script src="https://gist.github.com/704961.js?file=.netrc"></script><p>For each repo, do this:</p>{% endraw %}

{% raw %}<script src="https://gist.github.com/704961.js?file=gistfile2.txt"></script><p>And that&rsquo;s basically it.</p>{% endraw %}

{% raw %}<h1>Footnotes</h1>{% endraw %}

{% raw %}<p>1: Github crew, can we get a way to use our API token or some other revokable token as a password for HTTPS repo operations? I appreciate that anything involving &ldquo;revokable tokens&rdquo; is really hard to make a decent UI for, but it just feels bad keeping that in my .netrc file.</p>{% endraw %}
