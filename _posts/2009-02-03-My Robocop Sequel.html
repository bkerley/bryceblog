{% raw %}<p>Everyone agrees that Robocop 2 and 3 sucked. There was no romance, no intrigue, and
it was typical Frank Miller hack writing comic book fantasy cyborg and child-killin&rsquo; BS.</p>{% endraw %}

{% raw %}<p><strong>However</strong>, the time <em>may</em> be right for another Robocop movie.  OCP was a pretty great
evil company and we all know there&rsquo;s no shortage of those right now (just go down
<a href="http://www.fedspending.org/fpds/tables.php?tabtype=t2&subtype=t&year=2008">the list</a> haha),
so why not throw in a cyborg cop fightin&rsquo; evil mercenaries or something?</p>{% endraw %}

{% raw %}<p>SO here&rsquo;s the setup.  This PMC sets up shop in Detroit, pickin&rsquo; up where OCP (Omni Consumer
Products) left off, all hiring well-paid ex-Army dudes to block off streets Baghdad-style
totin&rsquo; assault rifles, but it&rsquo;s all wrong!  This is AMERICA, and in AMERICA we don&rsquo;t have
military fascism!</p>{% endraw %}

{% raw %}<p>After Robocop gets rid of them (not sure how that&rsquo;ll work, from what I understand
mercenaries aren&rsquo;t like ED-209 and do not spectacularly fail on stairs) there&rsquo;s more!  A
congressional hearing will be called, and Robocop will not be able to hire a lawyer to
defend him (he&rsquo;s on the equipment budget instead of the personnel budget,) so he&rsquo;ll have to
do a bunch of detective work and solve a mystery in the second act.</p>{% endraw %}

{% raw %}<p>Finally, after Robocop is absolved of all guilt, there&rsquo;s a third act with a sweet car chase
or something.  I haven&rsquo;t figured that part out yet.  Still though, I&rsquo;d pay to watch it.
Robocop rules.</p>{% endraw %}

{% raw %}<p>&ldquo;My own Robocop movie idea is &lsquo;Robocop shoots Wall Street execs through upper-floor meeting room windows for two hours&rsquo;&rdquo; -Josh</p>{% endraw %}
