{% raw %}<p>The compressor for the a/c in my car is dying, and it&rsquo;ll cost more than 1/3 of the price of the car to fix.  I did some math (guessing), and I&rsquo;m probably not going to bother with it, since I can buy sodas every day for a year (until I can get a different car with working a/c) cheaper than a new compressor.</p>{% endraw %}

{% raw %}<p>On the plus side, I&rsquo;ll be getting 36 highway mpg.</p>{% endraw %}
