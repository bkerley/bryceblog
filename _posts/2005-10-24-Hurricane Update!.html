{% raw %}<p>It&rsquo;s bright and sunny out.  There&rsquo;s basically no cloud cover (some extremely thin cirrus cover thousands of feet up is all I can see), the parking lot is as dry as ever, and it&rsquo;s finally below 80F in the afternoon (70F right now).</p>{% endraw %}

{% raw %}<p>Us Tampa jerks really lucked out with Wilma.</p>{% endraw %}

{% raw %}<p>But it&rsquo;s not so hot in Melbourne.  A stunning picture my brother took:

{% raw %}<p>That white thing is a dock.  It&rsquo;s nomally two feet above the water.  Now it&rsquo;s mostly a foot below, except for the parts that got separated from their pilings and are now floating.</p>{% endraw %}
