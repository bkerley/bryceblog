{% raw %}<p>So One Button Mod shows a real list of samples, exactly the way all the older players do.  It&rsquo;s nice to be able to read greetz :)</p>{% endraw %}

{% raw %}<p>I&rsquo;m still dissatisfied with the way the GUI looks.  I dragged some stuff around and changed it in Interface Builder, but I&rsquo;m not satisfied with it.  I might go for some of the <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/leopard/features/finder.html">grey hotness</a> that we&rsquo;re going to be seeing even more of in the next few months, but subclassing NSWindow&rsquo;s a long-term project.</p>{% endraw %}

{% raw %}<p>And if I&rsquo;m really lucky, Leopard will push the grey down to everything so it&rsquo;ll all be moot.</p>{% endraw %}
