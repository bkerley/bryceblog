{% raw %}<p><a href="http://radius.rubyforge.org/">Radius</a> is &ldquo;powerful tag-based templates,&rdquo; or in
  layman&rsquo;s terms, it&rsquo;s safe templates for Ruby that look like HTML.</p>

<pre><code><ul>
  <g:stooge>
    <li><g:name /></li>
  </g:stooge>
</ul>
</code></pre>

<p>Radius 0.5.2 kind of sucked though.  The more params you had on tags,
the slower it got:</p>

<p><script src="http://gist.github.com/54789.js"></script>
(left column is number of params)</p>

<p>Since our big app at work uses Radius not just as user->system templating code, but as
system->system processing code, we were generating Radius tags with forty params, which
Radius’s regex would have taken about <em>eight months</em> to chew up.</p>

<p>So
<a href="http://github.com/bkerley/radius/blob/c0157e4ee59c03b9a6ed946ced4ff850b26650d9/lib/radius/parser/scan.rl">I rewrote it</a>,
in Ragel which is just flat out nicer. Instead of dealing with a regex, you’re describing
a state machine; they both get turned into NFAs in the end.</p>

<p>Looks like the gem hasn’t built yet on github, so if you want it you’ll have to
<a href="http://github.com/bkerley/radius/">build it yourself</a>
(it’ll be bkerley-radius-0.6.0 when it does go). I’ll try to edit this post when
it’s available.</p>{% endraw %}
