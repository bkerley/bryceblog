{% raw %}<p><a href="http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2013/03/clogged-streets-simcity-launch-plagued-by-server-problems/">The SimCity launch last week was awful.</a> Long wait times to join a crashy client into an overloaded server cluster that doesn&rsquo;t even have the courtesy to replicate your profile to other clusters.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_labs">The Color.com launch in 2011</a> was awful. An unusably obtuse client connected to a creepily empty social network running on two expensive domain names.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.destructoid.com/dust-514-now-in-open-beta-on-the-playstation-3-242860.phtml">Dust 514 seems to be doing okay.</a> A lengthy and obvious beta period allowed them to grow and iterate the game to its current state, and will (hopefully) turn a profit and continue to be a fun game (Mac release please, thanks!) You&rsquo;ll notice there wasn&rsquo;t one single huge launch, just a gentle progression. No huge queues to join games</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/">Twitter</a> has been famous for teething issues (euphemistically known as &ldquo;failwhales&rdquo;), which is the opposite of Color&rsquo;s overcommitment. While there&rsquo;s been days when it hasn&rsquo;t worked (frequently during <a href="http://www.twitter.com/SXSWPartyzzzzz">large social media/marketing conferences like SXSW</a>), they&rsquo;re around today, will probably be around tomorrow, and they&rsquo;ve done a great job <a href="http://vimeo.com/55503728">rebuilding the service to handle the load</a> without obvious hitches.</p>

<p>Iterating software is cheap, iterating business concepts isn&rsquo;t <em>expensive</em>, and good will is expensive. While many people<sup>1</sup> have sworn off SimCity and other EA products forever, there&rsquo;s been no noise or <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/09/arts/video-games/simcity-from-electronic-arts-plagued-by-server-issues.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0">New York Times articles</a> about problems in Dust 514&rsquo;s early days.</p>

<p>You can <a href="http://gettingreal.37signals.com/ch04_Scale_Later.php">scale later</a>, but somebody that hates you for a botched launch won&rsquo;t come back later.</p>
