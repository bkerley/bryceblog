{% raw %}<p>Psyche!  This weekend&rsquo;s going to be busy.  We have a take-home test in Advanced Discrete that&rsquo;s due on Monday, and some senior project deadline&rsquo;s next week too.  Looks like I get to alternate between fun BCH stuff (NOT FUN) and making a recent version of <a href="http://librdf.org/">redland</a> compile in Windows (NOT A GOOD OS TO USE).</p>{% endraw %}
