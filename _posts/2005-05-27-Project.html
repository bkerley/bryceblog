{% raw %}<p>We got our project assignments in Software Engineering yesterday.  Looks like the whole class is doing the same thing in groups of two, and overhearing conversation on the way out, everybody&rsquo;s doing it the same way.</p>{% endraw %}

{% raw %}<p>The project is to build a POS-style interface for a video rental store that can hold details about particular movies (cast, crew, synopsis), customers, and instances of movies (who checked out, how long, when returned).  Since there&rsquo;s no real point in trying something new or exciting, it seems like everybody in the class is going to do it in PHP/MySQL.  Which is my plan.</p>{% endraw %}

{% raw %}<p>Funny how that works, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>{% endraw %}
