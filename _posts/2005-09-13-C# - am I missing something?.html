{% raw %}<p>One of my classes this semester, Software System Development, so far seems like the C# equivalent of Beginning Java at the ol&rsquo; community college, dressed up with a fancy name.  So far we&rsquo;ve written Hello World and a program to figure out if one box can fit within another (with fairly simple constraints).</p>{% endraw %}

{% raw %}<p>The Box problem, in the guidelines, dictated that the Boxes have to read their dimensions from the console in the constructor, as opposed to separating model from view/controller by reading in numbers in the main() and passing them in.  So I wanted to at least pretend to isolate the console-using code from the rest of the Box by placing it in a special constructor, and then passing the console values to the real constructor.</p>{% endraw %}

{% raw %}<p>But you can&rsquo;t!  Instead of letting me do something even PHP lets me do, if I want a common-constructor type deal I&rsquo;ll probably have to make a private init() method.</p>{% endraw %}

{% raw %}<p>So I don&rsquo;t get it - this Java rip is the new language for new hotness Windows programming?  It doesn&rsquo;t even seem as interesting as ObjC.</p>{% endraw %}
