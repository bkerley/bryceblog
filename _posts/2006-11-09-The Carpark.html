{% raw %}<p>In LISP, there’s a collection of functions used to slice up lists - car and cdr are the basic ones, but you can stack them up like this:</p>

<pre><code>(car '(1 2 3)) => 1
(cdr '(1 2 3)) => (2 3)
(cdar '(1 2 3)) => (car '(2 3)) => 2
</code></pre>

<p>These are kind of useful, but according to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAR_and_CDR">Wikipedia</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Most Lisps set a limit on the number of composed forms they support; Common Lisp and Scheme both provide forms with up to four repetitions of the a and d.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, since I work in Ruby more often than LISP, these functions have two weaknesses for me:</p>

<ol><li>They’re in the wrong language</li>
<li>There’s an artificial and arbitrary limit to how many I can stack up</li>
</ol><p>So I thought to myself � I can hook method_missing on an Array in Ruby…</p>
