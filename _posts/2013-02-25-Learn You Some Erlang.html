{% raw %}<p><a href="http://learnyousomeerlang.com/?utm_source=bryceblog">&ldquo;Learn You Some Erlang&rdquo;</a> is a book about the Erlang programming language by Fred HÃ©bert. It&rsquo;s useful, informative, and hilarious.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been touching Erlang on and off for the last few years, but more recently (now that I work with many Erlang users and community members at Basho). I took a class in some of the OTP behaviors last spring, but never really picked it up. Reading this book not only provides more narrative, but provides a nice structure for using the OTP concepts even without knowing them previously.</p>
<p>While API documentation for Erlang is easy to find (c.f. <a href="http://erlang.org/doc/">erlang.org</a> and <a href="http://erldocs.com/">erldocs.com</a>), Learn You Some Erlang provides a nice structure for actually using the concepts in example applications, which leads nicely into production applications.</p>
<p>The book has great and funny illustrations; technical yet with a nod to the whimsical, without being <a href="http://mislav.uniqpath.com/poignant-guide/">inscrutable and self-indulgent</a>. It&rsquo;s not Dr. Strangelove funny, but the humor makes it memorable.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re interested in Erlang, this is the Erlang book to read. You can <a href="http://learnyousomeerlang.com/?utm_source=bryceblog">read &ldquo;Learn You Some Erlang&rdquo; online for free</a> or buy it from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1593274351/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1593274351&linkCode=as2&tag=yershyemvu-20">Amazon</a>.
