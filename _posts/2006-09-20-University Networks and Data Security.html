<p>Thought this article was pretty good.  USF is kind of set up like this from what I&rsquo;ve seen, with a big mostly unregulated periphery and then all the exciting stuff firewalled off in different datacenters.  Individual departments aren&rsquo;t so hot on security, but that&rsquo;s how it goes I guess.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m feeling it too - just set up and locked down a new webcam at work, not sure when it&rsquo;ll be up.</p>{% endraw %}
