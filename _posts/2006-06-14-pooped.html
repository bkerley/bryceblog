{% raw %}<p>Still haven&rsquo;t completely recovered from CTF this weekend, although I am starting to feel better about the whole deal.  Although we might not get into Defcon CTF (depending on if one more team above us drops), I&rsquo;m figuring that since we didn&rsquo;t land any of the exploits against binaries during the competition, it&rsquo;s probably deserved.</p>{% endraw %}

{% raw %}<p>During the competition, I realized how much more I like Ruby than other languages I know (and some I don&rsquo;t, like Python).  Had to write a program to bust up an OGG file into different segments when nothing else could, and it wasn&rsquo;t too bad.  The HTTP tampering program I wrote was pretty useful too.</p>{% endraw %}

{% raw %}<p>Look forward to a miniature project site for this stuff this weekend maybe.</p>{% endraw %}
