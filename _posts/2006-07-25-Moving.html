{% raw %}<p>I&rsquo;m moving out of the crappy college ghetto this week, but it&rsquo;s getting harder every day as the new townhouse becomes better and better.  I&rsquo;m not even bothering going over there today, just making a list of stuff I <em>need</em> to get tomorrow.</p>

<p>Probably the best thing is the bigger kitchen, huge living room, and being able to grill burgers for lunch:</p>
