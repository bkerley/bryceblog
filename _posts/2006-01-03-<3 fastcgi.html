{% raw %}<p>I&rsquo;ve never paid much attention to how Apache manages to actually serve stuff (the only web server I&rsquo;ve ever messed with extensively was a class project a couple years ago), and the more I delve into it, the more confusing it seems.</p>{% endraw %}

{% raw %}<p>I&rsquo;m hoping that the software I switched to (<a href="http://typo.leetsoft.com">Typo</a>) is stable and updated for quite a long time, because getting Rails and such set up is more difficult than the equivalent PHP app.  Thanks, fastcgi, for making life difficult.</p>{% endraw %}
