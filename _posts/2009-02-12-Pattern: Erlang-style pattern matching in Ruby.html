{% raw %}Mostly for grins, I decided to implement Erlang-style pattern matching in Ruby on Sunday afternoon.

<pre><code>p.match(/lmao/) { :butts }
p.match(/lol/) { :buttes }
p.match(wc) { "atomics" }
p[888]
# => "atomics"
p["a butt lmao"]
# => :butts
p["lolqdb"]
# => :buttes
</code></pre>

<p>Fork/clone <a href="http://github.com/bkerley/pattern/">Pattern on Github</a>, and read on for commentary.</p>

<h1>How it works</h1>

<p>In the example above, <code>p</code> is a <code>Pattern::Matcher</code> object, that wraps arguments and blocks from the <code>#match</code>
method into a <code>Pattern::Entry</code> object, and stores those objects in an array in order of definition. When
called with the <code>#[]</code> method, it goes through that array and calls the stored block from the first entry that
answers positively to <code>Pattern::Entry#match?</code>.</p>

<p>A <code>Pattern::Entry</code> is basically a tuple of an argument list and a proc to execute on match.  The only real
cleverness is checking for a <code>Pattern::Wildcard</code> object, and checking with <code>#===</code>, which picks an appropriate
comparison for the objects involved (uses <code>Regexp#=~</code> if the left value is a <code>Regexp</code> and right is a <code>String</code>,
for example.)</p>

<h1>What could be done</h1>

<p>Things I’ve got ideas for but haven’t done yet include extending the Wildcard object to allow for <code>Array#first</code>
and <code>Object#class</code> (or <code>Class#ancestors</code>) checks, since those don’t work with <code>#===</code>.</p>{% endraw %}
