{% raw %}<p>Columnist Patrick Smith (the &ldquo;Pilot&rdquo; part of salon.com&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ask the Pilot&rdquo; feature) <a href="http://www.salon.com/tech/col/smith/2007/10/05/askthepilot248/">discusses the real source of the recent airline delays</a> in his column last week.  Basically, the problem is caused by routes being served by more small planes instead of fewer big planes.</p>{% endraw %}

{% raw %}<p>By dumping plane capacity in favor of increasing the number of flights, consumers get more choice, but (airside) airport facilities get used more, because a runway, taxiway, apron, or passenger gate doesn&rsquo;t care if it&rsquo;s being used by a massive widebody Boeing 747 or a dual-turboprop Saab 340.  Excaberating this problem is that multiple airlines competing for the same route can&rsquo;t competitively use a large airplane, but use two small ones (one for each airline) instead.</p>{% endraw %}

{% raw %}<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/60492034@N00/1511383354" title="View 'Saab 340' on Flickr.com"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2109/1511383354_057d8be003.jpg" alt="Saab 340" border="0" width="375" height="500"/></a></p>{% endraw %}

{% raw %}<p>For example, AirTran offers nine flights every Monday from TPA to ATL, and Delta offers eleven.  AirTran flies 117-passenger 717s or 137-passenger 737s; while Delta flies mostly 183-passenger 757s, with a single 250-passenger 767 and a 120-passenger MD-88 thrown in the mix.  Every AirTran flight is within 30 minutes of a Delta flight, most within 10 minutes.</p>{% endraw %}

{% raw %}<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/60492034@N00/1511413854" title="View 'Landside Equipment' on Flickr.com"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/2135/1511413854_4d6209995b.jpg" alt="Landside Equipment" border="0" width="" height=""/></a></p>{% endraw %}

{% raw %}<p>Why can&rsquo;t AirTran or Delta contract with the other?  Neither airline is exactly offering a unique experience, neither one pampers you in the least, so why not let the other fly more people on a larger plane, save the trouble of running a second set of landside equipment, save on landing and takeoff slots (those cost money at big airports), and create less noise and air pollution.</p>{% endraw %}
