{% raw %}<p>Halo 3 has a map editor built in.  It&rsquo;s awesome.  I think I&rsquo;ve spent as much time in there as I have in the campaign, and I would almost rather work on a map than play in matchmaking (no 12-year-olds spewing racial slurs in the map editor).</p>{% endraw %}

{% raw %}<p>The first map I finished, Dueling Dojo, was a tiny room with four spawn points and no way out, made by walling off the pipe room in High Ground.  There&rsquo;s no tactics or strategy to it; just murderin&rsquo;</p>{% endraw %}

{% raw %}<p>The second one, Contrivance, is the defending base in Last Resort (known as Zanzibar in Halo 2), walled off with a few crates and containers allowing for a few choices in moving out of certain areas.  There&rsquo;s some tactical elements to it, but it really boils down to lots of violence in an atrium.</p>{% endraw %}

{% raw %}<p>Whimsy, my third map, is basically Contrivance with a teleport link between two distant parts.  This changes everything, because there&rsquo;s now strategy with regards to fleeing and traversing the teleporter.</p>{% endraw %}

{% raw %}<p>With the release of the Foundry map, a more ambitious map, Crucible, became a possible.</p>{% endraw %}

{% raw %}<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/60492034@N00/2121133723" title="View 'Crucible 1' on Flickr.com"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2246/2121133723_c654a45e42.jpg" alt="Crucible 1" border="0" width="500" height="281"/></a></p>{% endraw %}

{% raw %}<p>Most of the original Bungie map can be deleted, and there&rsquo;s no shortage of construction materials.  I kind of wanted a smaller map like my first three, but with enough play area to bring in some more risk/reward factor than my first three maps.</p>{% endraw %}

{% raw %}<p>The way I understand it, a deathmatch map is all about choosing an investment.  Blood Gulch and its reincarnations do a good job of this.  If you want to hang out on the sides of the map with a sniper rifle, you&rsquo;re going to get kills, but not as many as if you were on an attention-getting jeep jihad or running for the rocket launcher in the middle.</p>{% endraw %}

{% raw %}<p>What happens if the reward isn&rsquo;t necessarily a weapon, but just better visibility and maneuverability?</p>{% endraw %}

{% raw %}<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/60492034@N00/2121133725" title="View 'Crucible 2' on Flickr.com"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2018/2121133725_179cf33da6.jpg" alt="Crucible 2" border="0" width="500" height="281"/></a></p>{% endraw %}

{% raw %}<p>Crucible is fundamentally two parallel planes to move in; ground floor with lots of obstacles and cover, and elevated floor with more visibility and maneuverability.  There&rsquo;s incentives for both areas in normal gameplay, but the top deck really shines in the Golden Gun custom game type (instant-kill pistols, no other guns).  The top deck shines for blasting fools en masse, but you&rsquo;re so exposed and it only takes one golden bullet to knock you down.</p>{% endraw %}

{% raw %}<p>It&rsquo;s interesting at least on the same screen, which is about half of my multiplayer.</p>{% endraw %}
