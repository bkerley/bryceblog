{% raw %}<img src="http://i.bf1c.us/Menubar.png" alt="No Battery"/><p>I&rsquo;ve had my unibody MacBook for just about five years. I still use it; even now it&rsquo;s a great little computer for kickin&rsquo; it online. I find it a bit slow for dev work (I&rsquo;ve been spoiled by faster computers), but it&rsquo;s passable.</p>
<p>Yesterday I pulled the (five-year-old) battery and found that it swelled up, which would explain the problems I&rsquo;ve had clicking the trackpad. Knowing the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pizFsY0yjss">dangers of malfunctioning Li-Ion batteries</a>, I made an appointment at the Apple store to <s>euthanize</s> dispose of the broken battery.</p>
<p>While the Apple store did have a replacement battery, this computer isn&rsquo;t worth the $100 they wanted (it&rsquo;s also been out of warranty for the better part of four years). I mostly use it on the couch, plugged in. The  MacBook Pro I use for work gets more battery life at two years than this one did new.</p>
<p>However, after getting home and having to cold-boot twice after the power connector disconnected, I did order a $40 replacement battery just to be a UPS.</p>{% endraw %}
