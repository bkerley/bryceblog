{% raw %}<p>When using the <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/omniweb/">OmniWeb</a> browser, sometimes it&rsquo;ll get really unresonsive and crummy to use.  Here&rsquo;s one way to fix it:</p>

<ol><li>Quit OmniWeb.</li>
<li>Go to ~/Library/Application Support/OmniWeb 5 in Finder.  In my case, this is /Users/bkerley/Library/Application Support/OmniWeb 5</li>
<li>Drag HistoryIndex.ox and the .log and .lock file (if they exist) into the trash.</li>
<li>Re-start OmniWeb.</li>
</ol><p>My guess (an educated guess, thanks to Activity Monitor&rsquo;s Sample feature) is that this index of history items gets corrupted, and OmniWeb gets stuck in a tight loop trying to read or make sense of it.  The index re-generates from History.plist pretty quickly on modern systems, so deleting it is no real loss.</p>{% endraw %}
