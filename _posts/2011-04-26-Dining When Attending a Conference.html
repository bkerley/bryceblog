{% raw %}<p>I&rsquo;m going to <a href="http://lessconf.lesseverything.com/">LessConf</a> this weekend, and I figured I should post some tips on how to get good service and have fun when dining with a conference group.</p>
<ul><li><strong>Forget going as one giant twelve-person party</strong> unless you set that up with the restaurant hours or days ago. You&rsquo;ll take forever to get seated and the service will most likely suck.</li>
<li><strong>Two or four person parties are best</strong> since the restaurant is already configured for these. You will get better service and have more fun.</li>
<li><strong>Seriously, split up your big party</strong> into groups that don&rsquo;t already mutually know each other. Meet new people, make friends, and have new conversations.</li>
<li><strong>Let the wait staff know you&rsquo;ll be splitting the bill</strong> before you start ordering.</li>
<li><strong>Have cash</strong> in case they can&rsquo;t split and you don&rsquo;t want to pack up and bail right away.</li>
<li><strong>Tip well</strong> if you&rsquo;re in the USA. 15% is reasonable, 25% is a great tip for food and drinks.</li>
