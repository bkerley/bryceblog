{% raw %}<p>Rainy day activity: learn another programming language.  Since Ruby and the Rails framework are internet popular right now, I figured I&rsquo;d try it.  After some hours and a trip for a sandwich and a book, I finished it and decided to look around for other information about it.</p>{% endraw %}

{% raw %}<p>I read the document about security, and lolled, because nowhere does the web tutorial mention that you need to use the h() helper method when echoing user-entered text.  I&rsquo;m half tempted to go on a google search bonanza looking for half-finished rails applications, but I&rsquo;m going to make some dinner instead.</p>{% endraw %}

{% raw %}<p>Also when it does the category filtering, it does it in the view instead of the part of the controller that calls the query, so with a zillion rows, it&rsquo;ll have to send all those to Rails instead of letting the database server send over the ones it needs to.</p>{% endraw %}
