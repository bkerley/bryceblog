{% raw %}<p>I went to a leadership conference today, thanks to the two clubs I&rsquo;m in needing leaders (and not just executives).  It was pretty fun, they got too much food so now I have tomorrow&rsquo;s breakfast done before sundown.</p>{% endraw %}

{% raw %}<p>I&rsquo;m really (<i>really</i>) excited about the CTF competition on Friday.  Zap&rsquo;s letting me borrow his old x86 laptop that actually has working card slots, so I&rsquo;m going to load it up with some linux (probably Ubuntu because I&rsquo;m not in the mood for ricer Gentoo).</p>{% endraw %}

{% raw %}<p>Off to get some work done.</p>{% endraw %}
