{% raw %}<p>Last fall I took Dr. Albrecht&rsquo;s awesome &ldquo;Programming Languages&rdquo; class at USF.  On a whim today, I took a look at one of the postscript programs I had written.</p>{% endraw %}

{% raw %}<p>Some parts I can understand readily:</p>{% endraw %}

{% raw %}<pre><code>(Grade Calculator by Bryce Kerley U-number) dup dup
.85 .90 1 setrgbcolor %spiffy watermark
-20 9.5 144 pt textdraw{% endraw %}

{% raw %}
0 0 0 setrgbcolor
2 10 12 pt textdraw %front and center
</code></pre>{% endraw %}

{% raw %}<p>Some parts I remember fondly due to sheer smarmy cleverness (i.e. using the rgbcolor register as a loop index):</p>{% endraw %}

{% raw %}<pre><code>currentrgbcolor %load current color
dup 1 eq %if our blue was last filled up
{pop pop pop 0.4 0 0.4} if %darken it down to purple{% endraw %}

{% raw %}3 1 roll %rotate it to the next primary or to brown/navy from purple
setrgbcolor
</code></pre>{% endraw %}

{% raw %}<p>And some parts that I forgot to comment I don&rsquo;t understand:</p>{% endraw %}

{% raw %}<pre><code>pop dup grades exch get
1 add exch
grades 3 1 roll exch put
true
</code></pre>{% endraw %}

{% raw %}<p>So, if you&rsquo;re working in a &ldquo;puzzle language&rdquo; like Postscript you might want to include more useful comments than you normally do.</p>{% endraw %}
