{% raw %}<p>It&rsquo;s nice being over the hump for the semester.  My birthday&rsquo;s coming up soon, one of my classes is finally getting to the interesting parts (no more basic object-oriented stuff!), and that sort of thing.  I can actually start thinking about Black Friday (have to see if flyers have shown up online yet), and registering for next semester&rsquo;s classes.</p>{% endraw %}

{% raw %}<p>I&rsquo;ve also started to get curious about what I should do after graduation.  While it would be nice moving on and getting a job, being a student is still lots of fun and I wouldn&rsquo;t mind doing research either.  I&rsquo;m going to start looking for scholarships, although I&rsquo;m still a year off from graduating.</p>{% endraw %}

{% raw %}<p>Also I still need to get the alternator on my car checked.  It looks so sad and dejected at the back/bottom of the parking lot with the battery disconnected sitting on a mat of wind-swept sand and broken glass.</p>{% endraw %}
