{% raw %}<p>Zap was over at the apartment today, and while the original plan was to take a big-screen TV off the hands of a friend, none of us had a large enough car (8" too skinny!).   After lunch with Zap and RC, we went to Wal-Mart, and we each picked up the fantastic $8 Nerf Maverick (see this <a href="http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2006/01/04">penny-arcade comic</a> for hot pics).</p>{% endraw %}

{% raw %}<p>If you haven&rsquo;t played with any Nerf guns for a few years (decade in my case), play with this one for a while, maybe with friends or something.  The three of us had a pretty good 10-minute skirmish for control of the long hallway in our apartment featuring lots of ducking behind cover, scrambling for darts, a couple instances of friendly fire (the back of Zap&rsquo;s head looked <em>so inviting!</em>), and a confused look from the third roommate immediately before ducking back in his room to avoid the barrage of darts.</p>{% endraw %}

{% raw %}<p>After some MGS3, fajitas, and Airplane!, I drew a target on the whiteboard to get some target practice from my desk (about 20 feet away), with some numbers I made up on it:</p>{% endraw %}

{% raw %}<p>(The scores, from the top down, are 49, 61, 23, sqrt(120), and <em>e</em>)</p>{% endraw %}

{% raw %}<p>I&rsquo;m not too bad for somebody who&rsquo;s a fair bit rusty:</p>{% endraw %}
