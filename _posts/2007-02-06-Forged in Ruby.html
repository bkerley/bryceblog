*** LOCAL GEMS ***

HTTPal (19)
    HTTP browser library

<p>You can still grab the source from my svn (the repos are at <a href="http://brycekerley.net/svn/carpark/">http://brycekerley.net/svn/carpark/</a> and <a href="http://brycekerley.net/svn/httpal/">http://brycekerley.net/svn/httpal/</a> ), and they now include Rakefiles to test and gem-ify them.  However, you&rsquo;ll need to make a <a href="http://docs.rubygems.org/read/chapter/21">gem-signing key</a> to do so without hacking the Rakefile.</p>

<p>Pretty much I&rsquo;m just using Rubyforge for hosting the gems, at least until there&rsquo;s substantial documentation available for either package.</p>

<h1>Licensing</h1>

<p>Carpark is public domain, and HTTPal is LGPL.  I reserve the right to change these in the future, and I still have to mark up the source.</p>{% endraw %}
