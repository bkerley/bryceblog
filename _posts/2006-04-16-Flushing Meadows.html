{% raw %}<p>Flushing Meadows is the final project my roommate and I are working on for our database class.  It&rsquo;s a database of restrooms and water fountains on campus, with ratings and comments.</p>

<p>The goal is to be cooler than all the other groups&rsquo; projects.</p>

<p>Also a Maverick Magnet update: part of my chair is ferrous enough to stick to, so I don&rsquo;t need that magnet taped to the upholstery.  The plastic in the handle of the toy is too thick to have it stick to my chair with the magnet installed inside.</p>{% endraw %}
