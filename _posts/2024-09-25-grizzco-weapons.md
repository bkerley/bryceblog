Splatoons 2 and 3 have a Salmon Run mode.
On some occasions, they feature 
[Grizzco weapons](https://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/Rare_weapon)
that are drastically different from other weapons
of that class.

Based on vibes and experience,
I feel like there're a few different eras of these
weapons in play.


<aside>
<h2>whoa whoa whoa slow down, what's Salmon Run?</h2>

Salmon Run is a co-operative game mode in Splatoons 2 and 3.
You and three players get teamed up, 
flown out to a purpose-built stage,
assigned weapons from a fixed (per-rotation) pool,
and fight your way through three waves of enemy salmonids
(anthropomorphized salmon armed and armored with repurposed kitchen gear).
Instead of just slaughter, you have to 
get golden eggs to drop by splatting bosses,
convey them to a basket,
and meet your quota before time runs out.

I've got 
[a more comprehensive explanation of Salmon Run]({% post_url 2024-05-12-salmon-run-under-pressure %})
in a previous post.

# Wildcard Rotations

Some rotations (once or twice a month?), 
Salmon Run's weapon pool
has three "normal"[^normal] weapons
and a single green question mark, 
which means one player will get a random weapon,
which might be a Grizzco weapon.

[^normal]: as if a Splatoon weapon can be considered normal

Sometimes, 
all four weapons are green question marks,
which takes the rotation away from your everyday
"good" composition or "bad" composition.
Instead, it's a per-round thing which is interesting,
because sometimes you might dominate with a good composition
and the very next match completely eat shit
because you got all chargers on a glowflies wave
or something.

Some weekends, Salmon Run's weapon pool is just
four golden question marks.
Everyone gets a random Grizzco weapon.
While the same per-round composition question still applies,
the power of the weapons will generally push
the whole event to a higher hazard level,
which means it's more intense,
and more rewarding.

# Thesis: Regular Weapons but Faster

The first three Grizzco weapons were the 
Grizzco Blaster, Grizzco Brella, and Grizzco Charger.
All three of these are basically regular weapons
but *more*.
You can shoot 'em all super fast, 
which guzzles ink, 
but the pure *speed* of these weapons
means you can usually find time to do that
in the intervals between when they're solving
all your salmon problems.

All three of these are powerful tools,
and while they're not equally good at every
salmonid you see,
these weapons are fun and satisfying as hell.

<!-- ## Grizzco Blaster

Blasters shoot a blob of ink a short distance,
and then it explodes. 
Different blasters vary the rate of fire, distance,
and how they deal damage.

The Grizzco Blaster fires fast as hell 
but has real short range.
It feels like it guzzles ink, 
but mostly just because you're always poppin' the party.

## Grizzco Brella

Brellas shoot a spread of ink.
They either have a shield that launches when you hold
the trigger down,
or a shield that stays put and absorbs some damage while
you keep blastin' with the trigger held down.

The Grizzco Brella fires super rapidly and has no shield
at all. 
Decent range so it's great for crowd control too.

## Grizzco Charger

Chargers are sniper rifles that need to charge up to get
to their full damage and range potential.

The Grizzco Charger charges up super fast. -->

# Hypothesis: Regular Weapon but Thoughtful

The last Grizzco weapon in Splatoon 2 was the
Grizzco Slosher,
a bucket that lobs an absurdly slow projectile that
is absurdly good at deleting some 
particularly troublesome salmonid bosses.
If you've got the bucket, 
you're officially on Flyfish patrol,
and not half-bad against 
Steelheads, Eels, Drizzlers, and Scrappers.
The downside is it's slow to start firing,
and you can only shoot it off four times before you need to re-up on ink.

This was the first Grizzco weapon that
was kind of divisive.
It's a hard one to get used to, 
and mechanically pretty different
from the other weapons that require 
the kind of planning it does.

<aside>

## Skill Issue

I've seen a lot of chatter about how
people who don't like the Grizzco Slosher
don't like it because they're bad at Salmon Run.
I don't think this is wrong on its face,
but it's important to remember that
no two people are actually playing the same game.

There are lots of brush mains out there,
a weapon I gave up a year or so ago 
because of joint pain.

Someone who didn't like the Grizzco Slosher
this past weekend might like it with time,
but haven't managed to grind with it.
It's only ben in rotation 38 times,
and only 12 of those was it exclusive.
People are often busy on weekends, so
it's always someone's first go with it.

It is okay to not want them on your team though.

# Antithesis: Regular Weapon but Tricky

Splatoon 3 brought the
Grizzco Stringer and Grizzco Splatana in 2022,
and the Grizzco Dualies in 2023.
I've grown to accept the Stringer,
but not the Splatana or Dualies.

The Splatana and Dualies are pretty similar
in that they cut out a lot of range and
instead turn you into the most useful
projectile.
This means if you're not extremely good
at deciding where you want to be in
15-30 frames,
you'll be a burden to your team instead of a credit.

The Stringer is tricky in a different way.
I feel like it focuses on
projecting damage and inking over a large area
instead of popping bosses.
Incidentally, it is good against Stingers,
and supposedly the Kings are big enough to
make it worth directly attacking them with the
Stringer instead of hunting bosses and using their eggs.
When you get close, 
it does get good at popping bosses,
but the charge time means I'm reluctant to get close.

I'd say that the usefulness of these is pretty
situational.
The Dualies and Splatana having no range
really goes against how I like to play,
and when I use them I mostly wish my
octoling knew how to swim.

<!-- 
As a class, Dualies were introduced in Splatoon 2
because having "2" of them 
would look cool on the box art[^art-atmosphere].
They're regular shooters, 
but have a dodge roll that trades some ink for
a different firing mode.
The Grizzco Dualies have comically short range,
but when you roll, 
you make an explosion that does enough damage to
completely splat smaller salmonids.
It's very different from all the other weapons
as you become the projectile,
but it struggles against many boss salmonids
and also rolling off the edge.
I feel like the edge thing is what gets me
even more than running out of ink
after rolling in to trouble 
but before successfully rolling out of trouble.

[^art-atmosphere]: Similar to Dualies, 
    the Stringer and Splatana classes were introduced in
    Splatoon 3 for art and atmosphere reasons.

Stringers are bows that shoot three or more
ink darts.
The Grizzco stringer shoots nine of these.
It's one of the stringers that
have the darts hang out for a bit
after impact to pop later.
Fully-charged, instead of the darts converging,
they spread out more, 
which makes it pretty good on swarms of 
lesser salmonids,
and also Stingers.
It's also thirsty, 
a fully-charged shot 
drinking as much as the Grizzco Slosher.

Splatanas are swords, 
with horizontal slashing attacks and 
charged vertical attacks 
that you can use to thrust forward.
The Grizzco Splatana cuts out the ranged projectiles,
subbing in a lunge that can
pierce armor and one-hit
almost anything. -->

# Synthesis: Regular Weapon but Incredible

The Grizzco Roller ("Groller") dropped in June 2024.
Rollers are inherently fun and hilarious
(roll them towards the camera and see your
character grin like a maniac)
and this one rolls faster than any non-projectiles
in the game.
As a roller[^cabron], 
it's top-tier at flattening anything that's not a boss,
and pretty ink-efficient at it too.

[^cabron]: and not the underpowered Carbon Roller

On Glowflies rounds it's a godsend,
because with everyone behind you, 
you can put it down, 
let ink start to regenerate,
and inch forwards when there's
too big a pile of frenzied salmonids pushing you back.

You can get Maws with a couple taps if they're in the middle of a
shark attack.
Eels and Scrappers (cars) get popped real quick if you can get behind them too.

Slapping with it is fine, 
as long as you don't do it while you're not flat-footed.
I was initially incredibly frustrated
with the vertical swing on it,
which feels like it takes an eternity
(72 frames, or 1.2 seconds)
when you trigger it by accident.

However…

*However…*

That vertical swing has two secrets:
incredible range and incredible damage.
You can one-shot a Steelhead from an absurd distance,
and transition smoothly to 
mopping up all the trash that spawned with them.

Does it have weaknesses?
Absolutely.
It's fast as hell and can't turn super-well,
which means if you're not careful
you'll be watching a lot of inkling swimming lessons.
Steelhead pops feel like a trick more than a strategy.
Maybe not something you can 
reliably execute while in the frenzy the last
thirty seconds of a round finds you in.

But I think that's fine.
The engine noises, dominating damage, 
and sheer groller glee you get are
just plain fun.

# Conclusion

There're a few holes in the
Grizzco lineup 
(Brush, Splatling, Shooter, 
any new classes for Splatoon 4)
that I'm excited to see filled.
If they're on par with the Grizzco Roller
it's gonna be good times.
