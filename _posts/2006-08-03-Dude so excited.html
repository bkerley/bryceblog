{% raw %}<p>I&rsquo;m blogging this from the airport, it&rsquo;s a little over an hour until I depart for vegas and defcon.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m still kind of torn on ACTF - while I&rsquo;m still confident we&rsquo;ll do well, I&rsquo;m kind of hoping that it&rsquo;s not going to be ridiculously hostile and full of people that just didn&rsquo;t feel like doing the kenshoto quals.  Also I&rsquo;m kind of hoping that it&rsquo;ll be possible to script stuff, because that really seems to be the thing we do well in competitions.</p>

<p>I suppose we&rsquo;ll se soon enough.</p>{% endraw %}
