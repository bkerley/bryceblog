{% raw %}<p>Up until this weekend, it had been a while since I&rsquo;d written any straight-up C, pretty much because I&rsquo;m done with C-only classes, and it&rsquo;s not terribly useful for the web stuff I do at work.  However, for this slicin&rsquo;-up-JPEG stuff for my senior project, it&rsquo;s pretty nice, since the fread/fseek stuff is flat out <em>righteous</em> for rooting around in a binary for metadata.</p>{% endraw %}

{% raw %}<p>I suppose I <em>could</em> do it in Ruby, but I&rsquo;d end up reading a bunch of bytes I wouldn&rsquo;t need, slowin&rsquo; it down (the slow interpreter wouldn&rsquo;t really be an issue, since it&rsquo;s all IO code anyways).  Since the application can&rsquo;t have a bunch of installation overhead, compiled code is probably better for the situation anyways.</p>{% endraw %}
