{% raw %}<p>I&rsquo;ve been working a few hours a day as a tutor at school.  While I&rsquo;d like to say I&rsquo;ve only worked with subjects from my department (computery stuff), most of what I&rsquo;ve tutored has been Physics and Calculus.  This is funny to me because it basically echoes my own experiences with those two subjects.  If I&rsquo;d had the guts to go seek extra help with those subjects, I&rsquo;d be a very different person today.</p>

<p>On the plus side, I&rsquo;m getting better at that stuff just by re-learning and teaching it again.  Two weeks ago I couldn&rsquo;t have done solids of revolution, but today I know both the shell and washer methods.</p>{% endraw %}
