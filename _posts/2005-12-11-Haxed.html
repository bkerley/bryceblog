{% raw %}<p>Yesterday was the iCTF game.  Needless to say, it was crazy, intense, and lots of things went wrong.  However, much to our suprise, we did pretty well for a bunch of rookies: (<a href="http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~vigna/CTF/final_score.html">We&rsquo;re WCSC</a>).</p>{% endraw %}

{% raw %}<p>It was quite different than what I expected.  I thought that teams would have about three flags on their machine at a time, and get new ones every half hour.  However, it was more like ten at a time, with new ones every minute or so.  In order to actually perform like that, we needed scripts to do the work.</p>{% endraw %}

{% raw %}<p>I made lots of tiny perl scripts, and chained them together.  At one point my command line was:</p>{% endraw %}

{% raw %}<blockquote>perl cprog_can_suck_a_dick.pl | perl flagchew.pl | grep MTN | php urlencode.php| perl flagsub.pl</blockquote>{% endraw %}

{% raw %}<p>Breaking that down, the first perl script (named because it was exploiting a C program called cprog that included inline ASM and called a perl script to do some dirty work) fed an enemy httpd an URL causing cprog to spit out the most recent flag stored in a particular place on their machine.  flagchew.pl put each flag on a different line, the grep separated out the flags from the chaff, urlencode.php worked as advertised, and flagsub.pl actually did the submission.</p>{% endraw %}

{% raw %}<p>We did get best logo:
