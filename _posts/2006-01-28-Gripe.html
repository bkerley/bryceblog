{% raw %}<p>As it turns out, making my OS assignment highly organized by splitting it into 12 files (6 .c, 6 .h) wasn&rsquo;t such a great idea, since the submit script only takes a single file.</p>

<p>Fixing this was a simple process:</p>

<pre><code>cat *.h *.c > bigfile.c
</code></pre>

<p>I then had to rearrange the order of the headers (command.h needed to come before child.h because a useful data structure is there) and a bunch of the #includes were redundant.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m giving a presentation to the ACM on Monday about subversion.  I figure that it&rsquo;s saved me a few times, might as well pass it on..</p>{% endraw %}
