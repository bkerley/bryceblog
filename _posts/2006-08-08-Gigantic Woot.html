{% raw %}<p>aCTF was great, we got the first score and stayed on top for most of the game (although at one point we weren&rsquo;t sure, as the team &lsquo;sudoers&rsquo; had a higher delta than us and we were just spinning our wheels), and when the game ended on Saturday we were still in first.</p>

<p>During odd breaks to relieve boredom (pwning is boring?), we met some of the people in real CTF, including Dustin&rsquo;s favorite hacker ever (on the right):</p>

<p>(side note - my what a great shirt Dustin has)</p>

<p>When the convention wasn&rsquo;t up, we pretty much went sightseeing farther south on the strip (north of the Riv is basically wasteland), including some really over-the-top casinos like the Bellagio and Caesars Palace.</p>

<p>Fun hacks from Defcon that I wish I was responsible for:
* Taking over Kenshoto&rsquo;s Asterisk server (being used for submitting flags in real CTF) with DTMF.
* Stealing an admin account for a university from the most hostile network in the world.
* Other things I&rsquo;m forgetting right now.</p>

<p>So the verdict is that Defcon is awesome and I&rsquo;m going again next year.</p>

<p>The other verdict is that listening to Philip Glass on the redeye back to Tampa makes you sleep.</p>{% endraw %}
