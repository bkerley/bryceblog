{% raw %}<p>It&rsquo;s over â€“ I&rsquo;ve finally graduated from college with my BS in CS, and I&rsquo;ve got basically no obligations for the three weeks before I start working.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s going to be nice relaxing for the Christmas break.  I plan on reading books, hanging out with friends (I&rsquo;ve been notified that there might be a D&D game at some point) for the break, and generally having a typical Christmas season with family and friends in town.</p>{% endraw %}
