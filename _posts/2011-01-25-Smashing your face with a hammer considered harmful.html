{% raw %}<p>Or at least I consider it harmful. If it works for you, that&rsquo;s good for you!</p>

<p>The title for this blog post should be &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like to smash my face with a hammer&rdquo;, which actually reflects that you don&rsquo;t like it, and does not lead the reader to assume that it&rsquo;s not just an opinion post. Please remember this next time you write a &ldquo;considered harmful&rdquo; thing.</p>{% endraw %}
