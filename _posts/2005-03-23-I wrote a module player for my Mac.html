{% raw %}<p>I was chilling around last week, and I wanted to listen to some module music (2nd Reality by Future Crew and some songs from Unreal by Epic Games).  Since there wasn&rsquo;t any module player on Mac that could play .umx files, I had to write a little player using libmikmod with the smarts to detect and unpack module music from Unreal packages.</p>{% endraw %}

{% raw %}<p>It was a fun learning experience.  I&rsquo;ll probably release it in a week or so.  It&rsquo;s console based, but it also doesn&rsquo;t suck the whole CPU of my 300mhz G3 Powerbook.</p>{% endraw %}
