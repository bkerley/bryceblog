{% raw %}<p><em>LessConf 2013, the last LessConf event, was a few weeks ago. This is a few short things I&rsquo;ve learned; more details in a future post.</em></p>
<ul><li>Everyone at the conference is cool. Don&rsquo;t just talk to people you know. Talk to everybody.</li>
<li>Is somebody standing alone and looking bored? Talk to them immediately!</li>
<li>If you&rsquo;re getting up from a table to get something for yourself, you&rsquo;re getting stuff for the rest of the table too.</li>
<li>Have cards. Have stickers. Using smartphones to move contact info around is still awful.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t be afraid to pop your shirt off.</li>
