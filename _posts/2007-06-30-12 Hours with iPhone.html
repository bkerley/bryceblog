{% raw %}<h2>Do like</h2>{% endraw %}

{% raw %}<p>Safari is about as good as it is on the desktop, which is to say, good-looking and fast.  It uses a newer WebCore than current OmniWeb does, so it shows the search form (top-right if you&rsquo;re reading this on my site) correctly with the fat black border.</p>{% endraw %}

{% raw %}<p>While I can&rsquo;t touchtype as fast as the duder in Apple&rsquo;s video can yet, I am seeing how it&rsquo;d be possible. The keyboard software is pretty great outside of password boxes or URL fields.</p>{% endraw %}

{% raw %}<p>I&rsquo;m a huge map nerd and I approve of the Maps application.</p>{% endraw %}

{% raw %}<h2>Do not like</h2>{% endraw %}

{% raw %}<p>No copy-paste.  This translates to no flickr links in this post until I fix it on a real computer.</p>{% endraw %}

{% raw %}<p>The calculator is only a 4-function like Calculator.wdgt that came with 10.4.  No computer nerd features :(</p>{% endraw %}

{% raw %}<p>Safari does something different with font sizes than desktop browsers re: points vs. pixels vs. ems.  A page that looks consistent on OmniWeb might have varying sizes on iPhone.</p>{% endraw %}

{% raw %}<p>Scrolling the edit cursor around big text fields is quite annoying, at least in the widescreen browser.</p>{% endraw %}
