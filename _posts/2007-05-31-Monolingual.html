{% raw %}<p>Lately I&rsquo;ve been feeling kind of monolingual, having pretty much abandoned other languages in favor of Ruby in the past few months.  Part of it&rsquo;s that I haven&rsquo;t had anything really to work on in other languages, and I&rsquo;ve also just been spinning my wheels trying to choose what to work on.</p>

<p>One thing that I&rsquo;ve been working on every now and then has been a module player in Objective C and with the Cocoa GUI.  I haven&rsquo;t got much progress on it beyond playing files, but it&rsquo;s something I can work on when not preparing for a competition in short order.</p>{% endraw %}
