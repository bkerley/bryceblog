{% raw %}<p>I got tired of the Mercenaries soundtrack, so I fired up Odelay by Beck.  It&rsquo;s a true classic, diverse yet cohesive.</p>

<p>Slammed through my Geography final today, checked through my Automata take-home and I&rsquo;m pretty pleased.  Software System Development (C# class) won&rsquo;t pose a problem, so the hard part of my semester&rsquo;s over.</p>

<p>Saw somebody on campus today I haven&rsquo;t seen since high school.  Amazingly coincidental, she was getting off the shuttle on the way to a job interview, while I was moseying to the exam.</p>

<p>DESSERT UPDATE: I just bit too far into my apple, and I still think it&rsquo;s the height of humor to declare the resulting situation a &ldquo;core breach.&rdquo;</p>{% endraw %}
