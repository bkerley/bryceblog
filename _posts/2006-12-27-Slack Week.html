{% raw %}<p>The week between Christmas and New Year&rsquo;s is always pretty slack.  I&rsquo;ll probably drive across the state for a couple days in Tampa before the graduation party over in Satellite Beach, but until then I&rsquo;ll probably read some book, help a friend of mine move across town (out of his parents&rsquo; house, and maybe work a bit on a Ruby HTTP library that lets me write less code than Net::HTTP makes me, but we&rsquo;ll see how that comes around soon enough.</p>{% endraw %}
