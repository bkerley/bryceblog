{% raw %}<p>Visual Studio 2003&rsquo;s build scripts are kind of weird.  The generator doesn&rsquo;t default to escaping directory names correctly, so you have to remember to put quotes around things.  It also just runs it as a batch file, which means that it has to inline a bunch of debug code to catch errors.</p>{% endraw %}

{% raw %}<pre><code>xcopy "$(SolutionDir)Redland\bin\Debug\\*.dll" . /d /y
xcopy "$(ProjectDir)win32dep\\*.*" . /d /y
