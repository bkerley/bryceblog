{% raw %}<p><em>These thoughts are things that occurred to me during my travels home from Scottish Ruby Conference. They haven’t been checked for accuracy.</em></p>

<ul><li>So I noticed that Weird Twitter really picks up at about midnight in California. Is that when the Burger Kings that weird twitter work at all close?</li>
<li>It sucks when you get on a plane after running your out-of-shape ass and a bunch of luggage through Heathrow and can’t get water right away.</li>
<li>It doesn’t suck when airline and airport staff have procedures to get you to your flight even when your inbound connection is delayed an hour.</li>
<li><em>In Time</em> tries really really hard to be preachy but it’s still a watchable action movie.</li>
<li>Curry shrimp is not my first choice for airplane food. It was tasty though.</li>
<li>It’s weird as hell how much you miss your cat after a week.</li>
<li>Shoulda set up ACE editor when I had an internet connection. Can’t build it without having pre-downloaded a bunch of stuff ‘cause it doesn’t look like I can just <code>cat</code> some files together by hand.</li>
<li>The Rockwell Collins in-flight moving map could stand to be as good as the iPhone’s map interface from 2007. A higher resolution and the ability to show both </li>
<li>this movie about bikes is cool</li>
<li>well it was until main character skidded over a set of skid marks obviously from a previous take</li>
<li>Sipping single-malt whisky while crossing the Atlantic is almost as cool as sipping it while hanging out with @tef and @ryanstenhouse.</li>
<li>I wonder if my luggage is on board? The agents at LHR said it wasn’t, but who knows?</li>
<li>Wine and cheese. Yes.</li>
<li>Does Daniel Craig’s James Bond live in a world where no James Bond movies exist? Or where previous James Bonds didn’t exist? I bet he’d really like some kind of suitcase helicopter during the intro to Skyfall but those don’t exist in our world and obviously don’t exist in his.</li>
<li>“This is 40” has one of the funnier pre-title-sequence openings I’ve seen this flight.</li>
<li>This really could be “Thoughts from 40,000 feet” because I just noticed that on the Rockwell Collins in-flight moving map on the big screen for the cabin.</li>
<li>Just “got” a joke about gout.</li>
<li>Nothing like a well-timed fart joke.</li>
<li>When did Judd Apatow become a good director? I’m thinking “Pineapple Express.”</li>
<li>How the hell did this become such a romantic movie?</li>
<li>Never mind.</li>
