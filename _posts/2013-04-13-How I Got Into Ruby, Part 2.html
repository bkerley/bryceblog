{% raw %}<p>I learned Ruby and Rails in 2005 after several years puttering around in other programming environments. Ruby stuck with me because it&rsquo;s easy to make programs do what you want: the builtin and standard libraries have lots of sensible methods, and the universe of Gems is comprehensive and ever-expanding. What doesn&rsquo;t yet exist is usually easy to build.</p>

<p>I got bored of performing the same security audits week after week and hearing the same excuses/mitigations for why clients weren&rsquo;t passing the audit. The most enjoyable parts of my work were building software. I took a couple days&rsquo; vacation to go to acts_as_conference 2008 in Orlando, and met Brennan Dunn, who was looking for Rails talent to work with him in Miami. I expressed interest, scheduled an interview, and moved to Miami.</p>

<p>I wasn&rsquo;t ready for the pace of that job. Getting requirements was a lost cause, because I&rsquo;d figure out out the right way to implement them, and then they&rsquo;d be different. This, the buildup of technical debt I wan&rsquo;t mature enough to handle, and the apparent ease of success to be had doing Rails consulting caused me to leave for a contract gig.</p>

<p>The first customer I had went too far in the other direction. The first work I did was to optimize a slow page by making the algorithm to draw it use hashes instead of arrays (going from O(n) to O(log(n)) on each row of a table), a ten line change. This was followed by a frustrating introduction to design reporting, design reviews, change reporting, and of course change review meetings; a process that added hundreds of pages and dozens of wasted hours to an afternoon&rsquo;s work. However, the checks cleared, and I was still having fun.</p>

<p>Once that wrapped up, I worked with another client on an e-commerce site for a year, and found that work terribly frustrating, especially when it came to contracts, delivery, and getting paid. During that year, I also took over the Miami Ruby Brigade, and found out that I really enjoy teaching and talking about programming.</p>

<p>One of my neighborhood friends, Matt Heitzenroder, informed me that Basho, makers of the Riak distributed database, were looking for a Ruby developer to help clients build web applications using their database. Since the independent route wasn&rsquo;t working out for me, I interviewed, and started at Basho in September, 2011.</p>

<p>Basho has been a fantastic place to work so far. Processes tend to be simple and functional, I&rsquo;m surrounded by<sup>1</sup> smart and friendly coworkers, and we work on cool stuff.  At the same time, I&rsquo;m happy with how far the Miami Ruby scene has grown; having weekly meetings leads to stronger meetups, and three of us are now teaching a ten-week Rails course at the LAB Miami coworking space.</p>

<p>Ruby&rsquo;s done quite a bit for me over the last six years, and Iâ€™d like to extend many thanks to the Ruby and Rails communities, past and present, for helping make me productive while still enjoying the act of building software.</p>
