{% raw %}<p>Today, I&rsquo;ll take the third Automata Theory test of the semester.  After that, I&rsquo;m free to slack for a few days before jumping back in to another project (metasploit project for security, weather station project at work, printing project for my awful awful c# class).  I&rsquo;ll probably end up playing Civ 2 after class this evening, because it&rsquo;ll be late and I&rsquo;ll be tired and hungry.</p>{% endraw %}

{% raw %}<p>The CTF competition got pushed back two days, to a Friday instead of a Wednesday, which, quite frankly, is a good idea since I&rsquo;m busy on Wednesdays.  Hopefully I can have some tools done by then (I&rsquo;m working on a PHP analyzer called SHART.  It&rsquo;s a backronym!), but mostly I&rsquo;m looking forward to seeing if we can capture at least one flag.</p>{% endraw %}

{% raw %}<p>The BBQ on Saturday ruled - steaks, salsa, salad, and after it got dark we channel-surfed between Modern Marvels: Engineering Disasters 17 and Die Hard with a Vengeance, which I strongly believe to be the best in the series.</p>{% endraw %}
