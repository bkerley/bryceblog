{% raw %}<p>Added a couple features to Chronicle for your reading pleasure.</p>{% endraw %}

{% raw %}<ul><li>An Atom feed is in place.  Use the link above, or hit <a href="http://brycekerley.net/rss">http://brycekerley.net/rss</a> to see it.  It&rsquo;s going through feedburner for stats, so don&rsquo;t be surprised at the redirect.</li>
<li>Page caching, thanks to the <a href="http://www.railsenvy.com/2007/2/28/rails-caching-tutorial">Rails Caching Tutorial by Rails Envy</a>.  Includes sweepers!</li>
</ul><p>More features forthcoming, been busy with the new Smash Brothers.  (Verdict: controls weird, graphic design awful (the stage select screen has six words in four different fonts), still fun).</p>{% endraw %}
