  I&rsquo;ve had this Chromebook for a few months now, and I&rsquo;ve got some thoughts about it now that I&rsquo;ve used it in anger a few times.

  Out of the box, it&rsquo;s kinda bad at everything, except it&rsquo;s not <em>too</em> bad at typing. The screen is shit, the trackpad is double-shit, the keyboard isn&rsquo;t great, it&rsquo;s slow, doesn&rsquo;t have many RAMs either. Chrome has an &ldquo;app ecosystem&rdquo; too, but it&rsquo;s mostly awful too. It doesn&rsquo;t hook into 1Password or Dropbox very well either.

  It is, however, light, has a keyboard, great battery life, and 3G. The lack of RAM means you&rsquo;re not keeping a bunch of distractions open, and if you&rsquo;re typing stuff, the machine keeps up fine, even in Google&rsquo;s awful apps.

  You can also run Linux on it. I&rsquo;ve got an Ubuntu install on an SD card that I can dual-boot with, and it&rsquo;s honestly quite reasonable: wifi, sound, and 3G all work out of the box. I haven&rsquo;t used it much for work (aside from <a href="http://blog.brycekerley.net/post/51819560503/riak-on-samsung-arm7-chromebook">starting Riak on it for the sake of having done it</a>), because I already have two MacBooks around the house.

  The ARM Chromebook is a good computer for typing on if you can deal with a compromised screen and trackpad in favor of good battery life and being really really cheap.
