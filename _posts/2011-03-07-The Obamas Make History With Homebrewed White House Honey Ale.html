  &lt;link-text&gt;The Obamas Make History With Homebrewed White House Honey Ale&lt;/link-text&gt;
  &lt;link-url&gt;http://obamafoodorama.blogspot.com/2011/03/obamas-make-history-with-homebrewed.html&lt;/link-url&gt;
  &lt;link-description&gt;&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama made culinary history when they served homebrewed White House Honey Ale, made with a pound of honey from the White House Beehive, to guests at last month’s Super Bowl party. They are the first presidential couple to ever charge their chefs with the ancient—and now wildly popular—art of homebrewing, according to White House Curator Bill Allman.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;How do I get some of this beer? A bottle from the White House would fit right in next to my Scottish empties.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/link-description&gt;
