{% raw %}<p>Sunday afternoon I tried the Border&rsquo;s on Dale Mabry, and they were sadly lacking the album, so I went and fulfilled my other errand (cough drops), and returned home to pick up the roommate who needed groceries.  Before groceries, we tried the Barnes & Noble basically a block away from the Border&rsquo;s, and they also didn&rsquo;t stock the album.  However, I did pick up the book &ldquo;<a href="http://www.dreamingincode.com/">Dreaming in Code</a>&rdquo; by Scott Rosenberg.  After dinner, I found the album on a DRM-free online music store linked to from the album&rsquo;s home page.  <strong>Nice.</strong></p>

<p>So, stuck in a hotel room in suburban New Jersey with the common cold and the sun tracing its final radians through the sky behind me, I picked up where I left off on the book (page 128) listening to the album for the first time (was in a Beastie Boys mood on the airplane).</p>

<p>The book is a fascinating &ndash; it alternates between an exploration of the concepts that make the art of programming difficult to control, and a tale of a <a href="http://chandler.osafoundation.org/">personal information manager</a> project going through a difficult start due to overplanning and desire to do the most futureproofly perfect thing at the expense of doing anything.</p>

<p>Simultaneously, the album is beautiful and haunting, owing greatly to JÃ³hannsson&rsquo;s inspiration from tapes of a computer&rsquo;s &ldquo;wake&rdquo; long ago.  As it reached its end, I paused reading to look up and adjust my lighting, as the sun had set to the point where the shadow along the wall was perfectly parallel with a misaligned identification sticker on the face of my work laptop alone and untouched on the desk on the far side of the room.</p>{% endraw %}
