{% raw %}<p>Got my k750i today - takes better pictures than my t616, also plays MP3s and videos.  Took it to school to take some photos of the business building for a presentation:</p>{% endraw %}

{% raw %}<p>This atrium (which is about three times the size of the &ldquo;fishbowl&rdquo; in ENB (Engineering 2)) is totally wasted because there&rsquo;s no good tables for eating on, and food and drinks aren&rsquo;t allowed anyways.</p>{% endraw %}

{% raw %}<p>The external wall up to the outside on the bottom floor of bunker is really pretty.  There&rsquo;s frequently a cool breeze down here, usually from an open classroom.</p>{% endraw %}
