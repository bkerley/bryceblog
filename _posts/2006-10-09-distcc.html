{% raw %}<p>Got distcc running this weekend, between my gentoo native desktop and my roommate&rsquo;s gentoo vm set up for the purpose (still &ldquo;needs&rdquo; windows, but doesn&rsquo;t use that machine often so the vm doesn&rsquo;t really slow him down).  Splitting stuff between my 1800+ and his vm 2800+ seems to speed up emerge a bit, which really shows when compiling kdelibs or something.</p>{% endraw %}

{% raw %}<p>It&rsquo;s probably not fast enough that I&rsquo;d emerge while suffering with XP in a vm on my desktop (thanks microsoft for making all the parts of c# people want to use closed-source), but I don&rsquo;t feel like going away for a few minutes while installing stuff now.</p>{% endraw %}

{% raw %}<p>It&rsquo;s just as well, too, since my iBook&rsquo;s in the shop for having its airport card blow up or something.  Turns out that it breaking as soon as I installed 10.4.8 was a coincidence.</p>{% endraw %}
