{% raw %}<p>iCal annoyed me with frequent error messages about Google&rsquo;s janky-ass calendar service being occasionally unreachable. On occasion, these messages would block the UI in such a way that required me to force-quit iCal.</p>{% endraw %}

{% raw %}<p>BusyCal doesn&rsquo;t! I&rsquo;m willing to overlook some UI strangeness (goofy panels, fonts that aren&rsquo;t pixel-perfect to iCal) for this.</p>{% endraw %}

{% raw %}<p><a href="http://busymac.com/?utm_source=bryceblog&utm_medium=http&utm_campaign=review">Try it for 30 days perhaps!</a></p>{% endraw %}

{% raw %}<p><em>This review is based on my experiences reviewing BusyCal during the 30-day trial period. I have not received any compensation, and nobody affiliated with BusyMac contacted me prior to publication.</em></p>{% endraw %}
