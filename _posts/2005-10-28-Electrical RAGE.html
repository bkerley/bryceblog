{% raw %}<p>Cars have too many things that can go wrong.  When I was leaving school yesterday (drove myself just to make sure my car still worked), it wouldn&rsquo;t start.  Got a jump, made it the better part of a mile, and it stalled at a crosswalk.  Managed to get the car pushed into a metered lot, and got a 72-hour &ldquo;it don&rsquo;t work&rdquo; sticker.</p>{% endraw %}

{% raw %}<p>So I guess the plan is to buy a new battery, drive it to autozone and have them check to make sure the alternator works.  If it&rsquo;s busted then it&rsquo;ll be a fun part replacement time (read: not fun).</p>{% endraw %}
