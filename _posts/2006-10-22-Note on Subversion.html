{% raw %}<p>Learned this today when setting up an fsfs repository; if users are going to be using svn+ssh or some other method that reads and writes to the database as their uid, you need to make the permissions setgid:</p>{% endraw %}

{% raw %}<pre><code>cd repodir
chmod -R g+s .
</code></pre>{% endraw %}

{% raw %}<p>What this does is makes any new files in the directory take the group of the directory, and not the primary group of the user that created them.</p>{% endraw %}
