{% raw %}<p>Got the common cold this week, so I&rsquo;ve started thinning out a role of &ldquo;budget kleenex&rdquo; with fun nasal emissions.  In addition, this debilitating disease made me miss a field trip to Celebration (town south of Orlando as an attempt at New Urbanism sponsored/run/owned by Disney).</p>

<p>Finishing up the memory simulator project for OS this weekend.  Got it running the optimal algorithm on a 10mb dataset in 10 seconds now.  As it turns out, reading the whole file into an array isn&rsquo;t <em>that</em> much more work than scrubbing back and forth in the file.</p>

<p>Once that&rsquo;s wrapped up, I&rsquo;ll hit the final stretch of the (now group) database project.  The admin side is done, all that&rsquo;s needed is locking the public out of it, and writing an interface for general users.</p>{% endraw %}
