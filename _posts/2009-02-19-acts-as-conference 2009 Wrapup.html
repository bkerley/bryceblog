{% raw %}<p>Spent a lot of time talking with <a href="http://coreyhaines.com/">Corey
Haines</a> about testing and the cost of fame for Rails people (you&rsquo;ll probably freak out, make a really inciendary blog post, and get a bad / horrible /
people-start-naming-their-projects-fu-yourname reputation), <a href="http://zach.carter.name/">Zach Carter</a> about all sorts of stuff, and others that are escaping me right now.</p>{% endraw %}

{% raw %}<p>It was pretty productive too: I hacked the twitter gem for Ted&rsquo;s <a href="http://github.com/trak3r/twitter2rss/tree/master">twitter2rss app</a>, gave a lightning talk about <a href="http://aac2009.confreaks.com/06-feb-2009-19-30-lightning-talk-regexes-vs-ragel-bryce-kerley.html">using ragel to fix
radius</a> (as seen in <a href="http://localhost:4331/blog/2009/02/radius-0-dot-6.html">Radius 0.6.0 - My Take</a>),
and managed to get enough talking about other languages on the mind that I ended up with an <a href="/blog/2009/02/pattern-matching-in-ruby.html">Erlang in
Ruby</a> hack not twenty-four hours later.</p>{% endraw %}

{% raw %}<p>The speakers were great too, with <a href="http://smartic.us">Bryan Liles</a> headlining with important tools and techniques in testing all the f'n time and b-boying, and <a href="http://hivelogic.com">Dan Benjamin</a> continuing his transformation into the Steve Jobs of Rails conference keynotes.</p>{% endraw %}

{% raw %}<p>With this in mind, I think I&rsquo;m going to have to put together a full-length talk for next year&rsquo;s conference (somebody hold me to that), and I&rsquo;ll leave it at that for now.</p>{% endraw %}
