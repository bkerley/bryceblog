{% raw %}<p>Finally feels like I&rsquo;m over the hump for the semester.  Midterms for most of my classes are over (the term paper in Ethics isn&rsquo;t due for another two weeks).  My big database project is coming along well (using Rails because it&rsquo;s less work than JSP), just got the third OS project (teaming up with Amin this time), and so on.</p>{% endraw %}

{% raw %}<blockquote>
  <p>It&rsquo;s a desert and it gets very hot out there. Daytime temperatures are well over 100° for several months of the year. Our audio from NPR (cited above) notes that it is a heat island and in last few decades night time temperatures have risen 11° fahrenheit. In addition, it is expected that soon night time temperatures will fail to get below 100° during the warmest months.</p>
