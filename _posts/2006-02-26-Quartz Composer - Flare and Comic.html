{% raw %}<p>I started messing around with Quartz Composer after last night&rsquo;s <em>awesome</em> BSG.  For those not familiar with the tool (included with the Xcode Tools distribution for Mac OS X 10.4), it&rsquo;s a visual tool for writing shaders:</p>

<p>From what I can tell, it traverses through all the different patches to produce a small and optimized shader, so you can be reasonably free with many of the patches that&rsquo;ll end up flattened and optimized out.  The compositions can then be used as screen savers, transitions or effects in iMovie, and other things I haven&rsquo;t bothered researching.</p>

<p>So, just messing around, I came up with a couple photo screen savers.  Since they&rsquo;re only really appreciable in motion (unlike my <a href="/typo/articles/tag/hlsl">HLSL shaders</a>), I won&rsquo;t post some ambiguous screenshots.</p>

<p>The first one, Flare, transitions between pictures by briefly overexposing the incoming one, just like a camera flash, while fading its alpha to fully opaque.  The second one, Comic (a single frame of which is hidden in the screenshot above), looks like you&rsquo;re zooming in to a black and white comic book while the picture fades in, at first behind the comic, and then finally overcoming it and coming through in pretty color.</p>

<p>Enjoy and mess with them: <a href="/typo/files/Flare_and_Comic.zip">20kb ZIP</a>.  I&rsquo;m putting them under the GPL so you can mess around with them.</p>{% endraw %}
