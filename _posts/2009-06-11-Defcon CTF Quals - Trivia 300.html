{% raw %}<p>This year&rsquo;s Defcon Capture the Flag qualifiers were this weekend, and as usual,
  I competed with 0x28 Thieves at the University of South Florida (which is in Tampa,
  and not South Florida.) The contest was a similar format to previous years (forty-eight
  hours to score as many points as fast as possible on a Jeopardy-style board), although
  the team running it was <a href="http://ddtek.biz/">Diutinus Defense Technologies</a>, instead of
  <a href="http://kenshoto.com/">Kenshoto</a> as in previous years.</p>

<p>The most fun problem for me was Trivia 300, phrased as such:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>pwn2.ddtek.biz:11511, provide 200 valid solutions in a row
and you will get a prize, but you better be quick!
Password == MAZE4J002PLAY</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Netcat (<code>nc</code>) to that server, password in hand, gives you:</p>

<pre><code>Good luck! You have 8 seconds per maze.
Maze solutions must be presented as a single line of input.

<p>Hey, I remember this from data structures!</p>

<h1>Writing your own</h1>

<p>If you want to try your hand at this before getting the spoilers and
hints below (or concurrent to them), I peeled off a few mazes for
you: <a href="http://github.com/bkerley/quals09/blob/dcdec7c06d705b7d1f8d11b4e115287bfea96760/trivia300/mazes.txt"></a><a href="http://github.com/bkerley/quals09/blob/dcdec7c06d705b7d1f8d11b4e115287bfea96760/trivia300/mazes.txt">http://github.com/bkerley/quals09/blob/dcdec7c06d705b7d1f8d11b4e115287bfea96760/trivia300/mazes.txt</a></p>

<p>If you want to use those with my code, you’ll have to rewrite it to
not shell out to <code>nc</code>.</p>

<h1>Maze solving</h1>

<p>There’s two high-level strategies for finding your way out of a maze:</p>

<ul><li>Depth-first: go straight to a dead end, rewind to the last unused
fork you saw, and try again.  Uses a stack to remember the current path.</li>
<li>Breadth-first: traverse every path from the current one, keeping
them in a queue.  Also requires a writable copy of the maze to mark
the traversed paths.</li>
</ul><p>Breadth-first is usually a better choice: it always finds the shortest
path. Also, I remembered how to implement it.</p>

<h1>Implementation in Ruby</h1>

<p>I’ve got links to my code here: there’s cusses since it’s competition
code.  Also, please excuse my horrible style (defining functions all
over the place, no classes, etc.) for the same reason.</p>

<p><a href="http://github.com/bkerley/quals09/blob/dcdec7c06d705b7d1f8d11b4e115287bfea96760/trivia300/mazer.rb#L17-L34">Lines 17-34</a></p>

<p>The first thing you have to do is download the maze, by reading lines
until you see one that’s all <code>#</code>s (walls).  Chuck the line strings in
an array.  While you’re at it, find the start.</p>

<p>Also, since ddtek occasionally generates mazes that have the start
point under the finish point, now is a good time to fail out.</p>

<p>When that’s done, the real work begins.</p>

<p><a href="http://github.com/bkerley/quals09/blob/dcdec7c06d705b7d1f8d11b4e115287bfea96760/trivia300/mazer.rb#L67-L93">Lines 67-93</a></p>

<p>In each queue entry, I store the row and column to be traversed, and
the path leading up to that point; the only entry at first is the
start (represented by an <code>s</code> on the map).</p>

<p>While there’s still queue entries, dequeue the first entry, get its
neighbors, and see if any are pathable or finish entries.  Add any
pathable entries to the queue (along with a freshly-lengthened path),
and if there’s a finish entry, jump out of the loop with the updated path.</p>

<p>If <code>Array#shift</code> fails to pull an entry off the processing queue,
plainly we’ve found an unsolvable maze.</p>

<p><a href="http://github.com/bkerley/quals09/blob/dcdec7c06d705b7d1f8d11b4e115287bfea96760/trivia300/mazer.rb#L98-L124">Lines 98-124</a></p>

<p>Finally, go down the path from the finish node, decoding it into
cardinal directions.  Send that over the wire, and go to the next maze
if you haven’t solved two hundred.</p>

<h1>Implementation Details</h1>

<p>Ruby’s <code>TCPSocket</code> was failing pretty hard, and I didn’t feel like
troubleshooting it.  Using <code>nc</code> worked okay, but what actually got
us all the way to maze #200 was using <code>nc -i1</code>, which basically
flushes buffers every second whether they’re full or not (please
do not use this explanation in any serious context.)</p>
