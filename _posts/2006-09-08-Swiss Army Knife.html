{% raw %}<p>Short post because it&rsquo;s late and I&rsquo;m tired, but Ruby&rsquo;s pretty damn useful if you have boring tasks you want to automate:</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env ruby
f = File.new(ARGV[0], 'r').read
f.each_byte do |b|
  $stdout.write('0x'+b.to_s(16)+', ')
end
</code></pre>

<p>in case you ever wanted to take your big binary file and inline it as a C array.</p>{% endraw %}
