{% raw %}<p>I worked all weekend on the redesign/relaunch of <a href="http://0x28.net/">0x28.net</a>, the site for our security group, 0x28 Thieves.  It used to be a boring site with a handful of pages, and nobody would have any reason to visit.  Now it&rsquo;s a tumbleog that I can post stupid stuff to (stuff that&rsquo;d be too short and pointless to post here).</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s still a few things left to do on it, but I can hopefully move quickly on that evenings this week.</p>{% endraw %}
