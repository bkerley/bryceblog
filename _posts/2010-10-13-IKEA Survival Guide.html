<ol><li><strong>DON&rsquo;T GO ON THE WEEKEND</strong></li>
<li><strong>SERIOUSLY, GO DURING THE WEEK</strong></li>
<li>Shop ahead of time and put the shopping list of the stuff you want on your phone or something (<a href="http://db.tt/Qlo3LXa">use dropbox</a>)</li>
<li>Rent a minivan if you&rsquo;re buying anything long or wide like a bed or desk</li>
<li>Eat right before you go in, or eat there</li>
<li>Buy your stuff and get out</li>
