{% raw %}<p>I just got a new video camera, and had to make an appropriate first video.
Here&rsquo;s something to start your day with:</p>

<p><object width="608" height="360"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube-nocookie.com/v/wV3BaUc1OGc&hl=en&fs=1&rel=0&color1=0x3a3a3a&color2=0x999999&hd=1"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"><embed src="http://www.youtube-nocookie.com/v/wV3BaUc1OGc&hl=en&fs=1&rel=0&color1=0x3a3a3a&color2=0x999999&hd=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="608" height="360"></embed></object></p>

<p>A few complaints I have:</p>

<ul><li>I need a tripod.  Cooking with one hand doesn&rsquo;t work.</li>
<li>I need to write what I want to say first to keep vocal tics from leaking in.</li>
<li>Editing HD video is really slow even on the current-gen MacBook.</li>
</ul>{% endraw %}
