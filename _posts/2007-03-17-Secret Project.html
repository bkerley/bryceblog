{% raw %}<p><a href="http://ctf07.usf.edu/">USF CTF 2007</a></p>{% endraw %}

{% raw %}<p>My friends and I have been working on a security capture the flag game to be played in just over a month.  So far it&rsquo;s been a long project with lots of ups, downs, and long discssions.</p>{% endraw %}

{% raw %}<p>For now there&rsquo;s still some stuff about the project that&rsquo;s staying on the DL, so more details in 34 days or so when it&rsquo;s all over.</p>{% endraw %}
