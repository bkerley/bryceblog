{% raw %}<p>Made a big milestone today on the ol&rsquo; senior project.  A week ago, I was <a href="/typo/articles/2006/09/24/rdf-is-a-pain">bellyachin&rsquo;</a> about reading XMP into key-value pairs.  Pretty much just today, I got enough code in to not just get the key-value pairs, but store them in a normalized sqlite database:</p>{% endraw %}

{% raw %}<pre><code>bkerley@thedude ~/[...]/ape> ./ape tests/bigxmp.jpg
Debug: XMP found at 0x000062d4
Debug: loaded 27 key-value pairs
bkerley@thedude ~/[...]/ape> sqlite3 ape.db "
select properties.id, proptypes.propname, properties.content 
from properties join proptypes on properties.proptype_id=proptypes.id"
(boring parts eliminated)

{% raw %}<p>What&rsquo;s next is porting the XMP reading part to C# for a visual XMP editor, which should be easy since I won&rsquo;t need so much custom code.</p>{% endraw %}

{% raw %}<p>All this and I also got my postscript project for another class done on Thursday afternoon (said class was cancelled).</p>{% endraw %}
