{% raw %}<p>I read a troubling article today suggesting that a plastic mock-up containing a printed-on screen and no electronics was a product. With that in mind, let&rsquo;s clarify what wording should be used in this situation:</p>
<ul><li>&ldquo;make-believe:&rdquo; a thing that doesn&rsquo;t work, has a simulated screen, or contains no electronics.</li>
<li>&ldquo;pretended:&rdquo; unveiling a make-believe product</li>
<li>&ldquo;playing with toys:&rdquo; hands-on &ldquo;usage&rdquo; of a make-believe product </li>
</ul><p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2011/05/30/asus-targets-christmas-ice-cream-sandwich-for-padfone-launch-v/">For example:</a></p>
<p>Wrong:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We just got to spend some quality time with ASUS&rsquo; newly unveiled <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2011/05/30/asus-announced-padfone/">Padfone</a> and you can see the smartphone that doubles up as a tablet on video after the break.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Right:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We just got to have playtime with ASUS&rsquo;s newly pretended <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2011/05/30/asus-announced-padfone/">Padfone</a> and you can see the make-believe smartphone that doubles up as a make-believe tablet on video of us playing with plastic toys after the break.</p>

<p>Thanks for your cooperation.</p>{% endraw %}
