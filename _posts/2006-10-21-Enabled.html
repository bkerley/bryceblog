{% raw %}<p>I enabled this site for <a href="http://hoodwinkd.hobix.com/">hoodwink.d</a> today.  The tricky part was getting the XPATH set up for the right spot in the page (you need quotes around the class literal).</p>

<p>If you want to get in on the metacommenting internet sub-layer thingy, you&rsquo;ll need:</p>

<ul><li>Firefox & Greasemonkey - I wish it worked with <a href="http://www.caminobrowser.org/">Camino</a> but there&rsquo;s no simple javascript injection system for that</li>
<li>To mangle your DNS to <a href="http://redhanded.hobix.com/cult/whoNicDOffWithTheYummyJunkDomains.html">nic.d</a></li>
<li>If you can see content on <a href="http://wasteland.hobix.com/">wasteland</a> it works.</li>
</ul>{% endraw %}
