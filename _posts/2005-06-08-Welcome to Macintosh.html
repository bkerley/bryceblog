<p>I got my Tiger CDs last week.  Haven&rsquo;t had a chance to install it yet, because not only is the Wallstreet (Powerbook1998) not supported in 10.4 (wasn&rsquo;t in 10.3 either), but XPostFacto, the tool used to get new MacOS working on old Macs, isn&rsquo;t quite compatible with the Wallstreet either.</p>

<p>So until it&rsquo;s updated again, no widgets for me.</p>{% endraw %}
