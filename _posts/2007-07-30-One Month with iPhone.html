<p>Maps are awesome, as long as you can catch enough street signs (or landmarks that are present on the imagery) to follow your location.  I wouldn&rsquo;t mind more control over caching in case you get stuck in a dead zone (found a few), but I understand why it&rsquo;s not there.</p>

<p>The iPod part is showy and works well, and power consumption with it isn&rsquo;t an issue for me.  Videos look amazing on it.</p>

<p>Killer app: camera -> email.  I can send to Flickr, send to Foodbloggin&rsquo;, send to whoever.</p>

<h2>Do not like</h2>

<p>Sometimes DNS gets a little squirrelly and I can&rsquo;t hit my IMAP server from my LAN, because it remembers the external/internet IP instead of the local 10.x.x.x one.</p>

<p>Speakerphone and ringing&rsquo;s kind of quiet.</p>

<p>Google needs to convert more YouTube videos to h.264.</p>{% endraw %}
