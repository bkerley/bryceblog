{% raw %}<p>Finished the final postscript for programming languages this morning.  It was a program to take a list of grades from a file and produce a chart showing how many grades fell into each letter (A, B, C, D, and F):</p>

<p><img src="/typo/files/grades.png" alt="Picture of example output"/></p>

<p>A fairly fun language, although not something I can see myself using very often.  It is way nicer than using PHP to draw pictures, just because the graphics features offer flexibility instead of just drawing lines and fillin&rsquo; stuff, but the general weirdness of the stack paradigm makes it more difficult to work with.</p>

<p>WHAT WOULD a postscript-like language in ruby look like?</p>

<pre><code>showpage do |p|
  scale 72 72
  moveto 0 0
  lineto 10 10
  lineto 0 10
  lineto 0 0
  setsrokewidth 1 pt
  stroke
end
</code></pre>

<p>Transforming that to PS might be a pain, but it&rsquo;d be a pretty neat ruby graphics API anyways.</p>{% endraw %}
