{% raw %}<p>I was walking through the Marshall Center at school today to get some paperwork done for the ACM competition later this month, when my knee decided it didn&rsquo;t feel like walkin&rsquo; anymore.  I hit the floor, yelled for help, and a nice dude from the Marshall Center staff was there quickly.  An ambulance was called, and a campus police officer there basically stood around and talked with me.  Eventually the paramedics came (thanks Special Events Center destruction project!), and I was put on a stretcher and wheeled out.</p>

<p>Once I got to the hospital, I was put in a pediatrics room after a short wait (wasn&rsquo;t busy, but all the other rooms were full I guess), and saw a pediatrician working the area.  His analysis of my dislocated kneecap and description of the situation led him to understand that if I straightened out my leg, I&rsquo;d be fine.  Sure enough, after a deep breath and a little bit of pain, it was done.  After some x-rays (OH GOD THE X RAYS), and some paperwork, I was out of there with a brace on my knee and crutches.</p>

<p>So now I&rsquo;m on the couch and watching the Trek on TV.  The rest of the ACM officers are getting the paperwork done (thanks Amin and John!), and I&rsquo;m just taking it easy for the evening.</p>{% endraw %}
