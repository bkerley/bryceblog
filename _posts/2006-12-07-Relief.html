{% raw %}<p>Got Monday&rsquo;s advanced discrete test back with a 90 today, which means that it&rsquo;s relatively easy for me to get a B in the class for the semester.  Also slammed through the last regular Human Geography test today (although the lack of an essay was disappointing), and <strong>almost</strong> presented the senior project (but ran out of between-class time).</p>

<p>UCSB CTF is Friday (I&rsquo;ve had a dashbaord widget counting down the minutes and seconds for two weeks), and after that I just have exams and graduation.  Booyah.</p>{% endraw %}
