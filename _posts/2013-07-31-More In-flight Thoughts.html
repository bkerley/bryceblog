{% raw %}<ul><li>Welcome to Hell: this airplane ostensibly has wifi but it&rsquo;s not DHCPing anybody.</li>
<li>One of the flight attendants has really cute glasses that work well with her bangs.</li>
<li>ACHIEVEMENT UNLOCKED: Run the plane out of Glenlivet.</li>
<li>The &ldquo;Wonderstone&rdquo; movie is a good movie to watch on the way to Vegas.</li>
<li>The &ldquo;Wonderstone&rdquo; movie makes me think of Ben Stiller&rsquo;s &ldquo;Tony Wonder&rdquo; from Arrested Development.</li>
<li>Thanks Apple, for making a MacBook Pro that doesn&rsquo;t work on airline AC outlets.</li>
<li>I kind of miss the part of IE6 where you could browse the cache folder and see sensible filenames and pluck images out of it.</li>
<li>I don&rsquo;t miss <code>Untitled.bmp</code>.</li>
<li>SLAM TO THE JAM: knocked out streaming of list_buckets in riak-ruby-client.</li>
<li>PROTIP for when you&rsquo;re doing Riak stuff and not online: if you&rsquo;ve built it from source, source code for Riak is in <code>src/PACKAGE_NAME/src</code>
</li>
<li>I love that I can look out the window between Miami and Las Vegas and get a general idea of where I am based on the terrain: Gulf of Mexico? Louisiana farmland? Texas scrub? The Wild West?</li>
<li>Doing Rails sucks without Internet access, probably because Rails is pretty much the sigma sum of computing: SQL, Ruby, HTML, CSS, JavaScript. None of these have particularly amazing offline documentation; or at least I don&rsquo;t have the offline documentation for most of it.</li>
<li>Remember before TV stations could superimpose a graphic on a TV show? It was a lot nicer than now, when superimposing a graphic on a TV show is as easy as not superimposing a graphic on a TV show.</li>
<li>Non-stop flights best flights.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s weird seeing Upright Citizens Brigade alumni in roles that aren&rsquo;t spectacularly hilarious; it&rsquo;s okay when they&rsquo;re opposite Leslie Knope though.</li>
<li>I wonder how bad 3M® Command™ Adhesive would mess up the dashboard of my car…</li>
<li>Where is my iTrip cigarette lighter iPhone charger/AV cable? Thing rules.</li>
<li>Fred Armisen is in a lot of things.</li>
