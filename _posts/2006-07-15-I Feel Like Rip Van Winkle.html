{% raw %}<p>Cipher2 was this morning - 2am-10am local time, so I slept late on Thursday and pulled an all-nighter.  After the game (dropped to 2nd after spending the majority of the time in 1st), I came home and fell asleep (about 10:30am).</p>{% endraw %}

{% raw %}<p>I slept until 8pm.</p>{% endraw %}

{% raw %}<p>It&rsquo;s going to be a fun weekend flipping my schedule around.</p>{% endraw %}

{% raw %}<p>I&rsquo;ll see if I can post pictures later after dinner or something.</p>{% endraw %}
