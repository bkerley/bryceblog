{% raw %}<p>Yesterday I gave a speech at the ACM meeting.  It was officer election day.  Throughont the preceding 24 hours or so, I had <s>painstakingly</s> half-assedly prepared a speech for my campaign.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s hard staying on topic when you&rsquo;re just so <em>excited</em> about an upcoming trip during spring break.  The <a href="http://wcsc.myweb.usf.edu">WCSC</a> group is taking a trip to Georgia this weekend for a computer security competition, and I&rsquo;m not even sure where to get started in preparing for it, because it&rsquo;s all IT security and not actually an attack/defense exercise.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s going to be an interesting year as ACM president.</p>{% endraw %}
