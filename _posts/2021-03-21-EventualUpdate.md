Hey.

I've updated my blog after six years.

Things are well! Stuff I was doing on the side in 2013 got more serious,
I quit posting to Tumblr from Path on iOS lmao. I did post on
Twitter a bunch, now I post a bunch on Mastodon.

I'm kind of the same guy,
kind of different, so while I'm not gonna go delete a bunch of posts I don't
completely agree with or find relevant anymore, I'm probably going to
deÃ«mphasize them a bit.

I want to do some more long form writing because the prospects of making a
video seems like a lot more work to do well than just writing (since a good
video starts with writing anyways.)
